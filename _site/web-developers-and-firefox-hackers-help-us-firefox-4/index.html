<div class="post">
<p>We need some web-savvy people to help us audit the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/">Torbutton alpha series</a> for Firefox 4. I&#39;ve performed a preliminary audit, and Torbutton 1.3.2-alpha should be safe from major issues, but a lot more testing is needed. In particular, we need people to test the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox_4_for_developers">new Firefox 4 features</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbutton.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/website/design/FF40_AUDIT">notes from my preliminary audit</a> are available in the Torbutton git repository, but note that I have not tested everything that struck me as potentially troublesome, and there may be other things I missed too.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the types of things we are looking for are things that violate the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/#requirements">Torbutton Security Requirements</a>, which may include new ways to bypass proxy settings, to fingerprint users, or to use novel identifiers to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity.</p>

<p>In addition, we may have some funding to address <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/#FirefoxBugs">outstanding Torbutton-related bugs</a> in Firefox. If you know C++ and/or Firefox internals, we should be able to pay you for your time to address these issues and shepherd the relevant patches through Mozilla&#39;s review process.</p>

<p>If you find issues, or if you are interested in working on fixing these bugs, please contact us at tor-assistants at torproject dot org. Torbutton bugs that you find can be added to the growing pile at the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/report/14">Torbutton Bug Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>The sooner we get these issues taken care of, the sooner we can confidently release a stable Torbutton for Firefox 4.</p>
