<p>Tor 0.2.0.31 addresses two potential anonymity issues, starts to fix<br>
a big bug we&#39;re seeing where in rare cases traffic from one Tor stream<br>
gets mixed into another stream, and fixes a variety of smaller issues.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.31 - 2008-09-03<br>
 o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Make sure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection<br>
 with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This<br>
 is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc.<br>
 - Relays now reject risky extend cells: if the extend cell includes<br>
 a digest of all zeroes, or asks to extend back to the relay that<br>
 sent the extend cell, tear down the circuit. Ideas suggested<br>
 by rovv.<br>
 - If not enough of our entry guards are available so we add a new<br>
 one, we might use the new one even if it overlapped with the<br>
 current circuit&#39;s exit relay (or its family). Anonymity bugfix<br>
 pointed out by rovv.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:<br>
 - Recover 3-7 bytes that were wasted per memory chunk. Fixes bug<br>
 794; bug spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.<br>
 - Correctly detect the presence of the linux/netfilter_ipv4.h header<br>
 when building against recent kernels. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.<br>
 - Pick size of default geoip filename string correctly on windows.<br>
 Fixes bug 806. Bugfix on 0.2.0.30.<br>
 - Make the autoconf script accept the obsolete --with-ssl-dir<br>
 option as an alias for the actually-working --with-openssl-dir<br>
 option. Fix the help documentation to recommend --with-openssl-dir.<br>
 Based on a patch by &quot;Dave&quot;. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.<br>
 - Disallow session resumption attempts during the renegotiation<br>
 stage of the v2 handshake protocol. Clients should never be trying<br>
 session resumption at this point, but apparently some did, in<br>
 ways that caused the handshake to fail. Bug found by Geoff Goodell.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.<br>
 - When using the TransPort option on OpenBSD, and using the User<br>
 option to change UID and drop privileges, make sure to open<br>
 /dev/pf before dropping privileges. Fixes bug 782. Patch from<br>
 Christopher Davis. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.<br>
 - Try to attach connections immediately upon receiving a RENDEZVOUS2<br>
 or RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED cell. This can save a second or two<br>
 on the client side when connecting to a hidden service. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.0.6pre1. Found and fixed by Christian Wilms; resolves bug 743.<br>
 - When closing an application-side connection because its circuit is<br>
 getting torn down, generate the stream event correctly. Bugfix on<br>
 0.1.2.x. Anonymous patch.</p>
