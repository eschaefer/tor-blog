<div class="post">
<p>Once again, with sponsorship from the amazing folks at the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, the Tor Project has been accepted as a mentoring organization in Google&#39;s <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Summer of Code</a>. This program funds students to work on open source and free software projects over the summer, and provides organizations like ours with a chance to work with great and enthusiastic coders from around the world.</p>

<p>Many thanks first to Google for the opportunity, and to EFF for their continuing help and support. We&#39;d also like to thanks everyone in the Tor community who agreed to help mentor students with us this summer, especially those who contributed to our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/volunteer.html#Projects">project ideas list</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a student interested in working with the Tor Project under the Google Summer of Code program this year, please check out <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html">Google&#39;s FAQ for the program</a>, and the Tor Project&#39;s <a href="https://torproject.org/gsoc.html">GSoC 2008</a> page for more information. If you have any questions that aren&#39;t answered there, just stop by our IRC channel and ask. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>Also, be sure to check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">other great organizations</a> who will be mentoring students this year.</p>
