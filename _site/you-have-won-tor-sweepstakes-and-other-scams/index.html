<div class="event">
<p>Over the past 18 months someone has been mailing fake checks from us to individuals all over the United States. The text of the letter one receives is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Merchant &amp; Bryce, Partners in Finance.<br>
To: victim</p>

<p>Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that you are one of the 26 declared lucky winners of our 2009 Dreams Sweepstakes(tm) held on [pick a date] in the 2nd category.

<p>I&#39;ve replaced the unique amounts and numbers with text in brackets [] to highlight what&#39;s changed. Otherwise, the letters are all the same.</p>

<p>The checks are written against our public donation bank account, which is a deposit-only savings account. The checks themselves are signed by various people, typically Paul Lylesworth or Frank Anderson. However, Walmart cashed the checks without verification and then sent bill collectors after us for not honoring the checks. Sometimes the checks are written from The Tar Project.</p>

<p>Most victims find our phone number on the press page and call to ask, &quot;Is this for real?&quot; As they suspect, it is not real and is a scam.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also removed the claim numbers and amounts to protect those that sent to us copies of the letters and checks they received in the mail, and that are working with the local Police on this case.</p>

<p>As for as some basic sleuthing, the phone numbers NPA-NPX are assigned to MagicJack in Los Angeles, California. The letters themselves are mailed from Canada. postal code M4L 3T6. This is Toronto, Ontario.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all we know. If you receive an unexpected check from us, it&#39;s fake.</p>
