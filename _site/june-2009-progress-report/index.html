<p><strong>Censorship circumvention</strong></p>

<p>Packaged rpms for Red Flag Linux version 6. Red Flag Linux is reported to be the new operating system for all Internet cafe&#39;s in China. So far, no one has seen this conversion actually happen, but now we&#39;re ready if it does.</p>

<p>Our email autoresponder, gettor , received a number of patches to deal with dkim issues, including finding a dkim bug that prevented yahoo email users from fetching Tor. This bug has been fixed. Additionally, we&#39;ve whitelisted some domains where we<br>
see we&#39;re having lots of use but dkim isn&#39;t always configured properly. We&#39;ve had thousands of users from China using gettor.</p>

<p><strong>Outreach/Advocacy</strong></p>

<p>Andrew, Roger, and Wendy attended Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2009 Conference ( <a href="http://www.cfp2009.org" title="http://www.cfp2009.org">http://www.cfp2009.org</a>). Andrew presented a “quicktake” talk on “Who uses Tor?”. Andrew and Roger, along with Paul Syverson, and a North African blogger, hosted a panel on “It Takes A Village To Be Anonymous”. Due to the sensitive situation surrounding the blogger, this panel was not recorded.</p>

<p>Andrew talked with the Committee to Protect Journalists ( <a href="http://cpj.org" title="http://cpj.org">http://cpj.org</a>) about online security and circumvention tools.</p>

<p>Jillian C. York blogged at KnightPulse about “Average citizens browse anonymously<br>
”, <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymously" title="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymously">http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymo...</a></p>

<p>Due to Iranian&#39;s usage of Tor during the recent election, the general press/media conducted a few interviews with Andrew:</p>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 released in June. Planning a migration of the base operating system for the Incognito LiveCD to switch from Gentoo to an Ubuntu variant. We can always use help in maintaining Incognito.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<p>June was spent documenting, stabilizing, and streamlining the bandwidth authority scanner, which has been runningfor a while on the Directory Authority named ides.</p>

<p>It is good enough to start running on multiple authorities now to produce actual results for clients to use.</p>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>Our email autoresponder, gettor , received a number of patches to deal with dkim issues, including finding a dkim bug that prevented yahoo email users from fetching Tor. This bug<br>
has been fixed. Additionally, we&#39;ve whitelisted some domains where we see we&#39;re having lots of use but dkim isn&#39;t always configured properly. We&#39;ve had thousands of users from China using gettor.</p>

<p>The Tor Check website (check.torproject.org) had a few bugs and we&#39;ve fixed all but two. We sometimes still have false negatives (because the Tor client doesn&#39;t know to fetch the consensus at any specific time) and we also still sometimes barf python exceptions because mod_python has some weird exception from time to time. We also accepted a patch from Marcus Greip that extends the TorBulkExitList to allow arbitrary ports rather than just port 80.</p>

<p><strong>Footprints from Tor Browser Bundle.</strong></p>

<p>Reduced the scanning for plugins Portable Firefox can do on launch of the application. There is still an issue where Firefox displays other plugins to users, but they aren&#39;t actually valid plugins and won&#39;t run on command. Firefox acquires the names through queries to the Windows Registry.</p>
