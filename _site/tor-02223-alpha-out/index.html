<div class="event">
<p>Tor 0.2.2.23-alpha lets relays record their bandwidth history so when<br>
 they restart they don&#39;t lose their bandwidth capacity estimate. This<br>
 release also fixes a diverse set of user-facing bugs, ranging from<br>
 relays overrunning their rate limiting to clients falsely warning about<br>
 clock skew to bridge descriptor leaks by our bridge directory authority.</p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stop sending a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever<br>
we fetch directory information from a relay that has a wrong clock.<br>
Instead, only inform the controller when it&#39;s a trusted authority<br>
that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha; fixes<br>
the rest of bug 1074.</li>
<li>Fix an assert in parsing router descriptors containing IPv6<br>
addresses. This one took down the directory authorities when<br>
somebody tried some experimental code. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Make the bridge directory authority refuse to answer directory<br>
requests for &quot;all&quot; descriptors. It used to include bridge<br>
descriptors in its answer, which was a major information leak.<br>
Found by &quot;piebeer&quot;. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>If relays set RelayBandwidthBurst but not RelayBandwidthRate,<br>
Tor would ignore their RelayBandwidthBurst setting,<br>
potentially using more bandwidth than expected. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.1-alpha. Reported by Paul Wouters. Fixes bug 2470.</li>
<li>Ignore and warn if the user mistakenly sets &quot;PublishServerDescriptor<br>
hidserv&quot; in her torrc. The &#39;hidserv&#39; argument never controlled<br>
publication of hidden service descriptors. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Relays now save observed peak bandwidth throughput rates to their<br>
state file (along with total usage, which was already saved)<br>
so that they can determine their correct estimated bandwidth on<br>
restart. Resolves bug 1863, where Tor relays would reset their<br>
estimated bandwidth to 0 after restarting.</li>
<li>Directory authorities now take changes in router IP address and<br>
ORPort into account when determining router stability. Previously,<br>
if a router changed its IP or ORPort, the authorities would not<br>
treat it as having any downtime for the purposes of stability<br>
calculation, whereas clients would experience downtime since the<br>
change could take a while to propagate to them. Resolves issue 1035.</li>
<li>Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution<br>
Prevention (DEP) by default on Windows to make it harder for<br>
attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Patch from John Brooks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x and earlier):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a rare crash bug that could occur when a client was configured<br>
with a large number of bridges. Fixes bug 2629; bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.2-alpha. Bugfix by trac user &quot;shitlei&quot;.</li>
<li>Avoid a double mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a<br>
transparent proxy connection. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha. Fixes<br>
bug 2279.</li>
<li>Correctly detect failure to allocate an OpenSSL BIO. Fixes bug 2378;<br>
found by &quot;cypherpunks&quot;. This bug was introduced before the first<br>
Tor release, in svn commit r110.</li>
<li>Country codes aren&#39;t supported in EntryNodes until 0.2.3.x, so<br>
don&#39;t mention them in the manpage. Fixes bug 2450; issue<br>
spotted by keb and G-Lo.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in bandwidth history state parsing that could have been<br>
triggered if a future version of Tor ever changed the timing<br>
granularity at which bandwidth history is measured. Bugfix on<br>
Tor 0.1.1.11-alpha.</li>
<li>When a relay decides that its DNS is too broken for it to serve<br>
as an exit server, it advertised itself as a non-exit, but<br>
continued to act as an exit. This could create accidental<br>
partitioning opportunities for users. Instead, if a relay is<br>
going to advertise reject *:* as its exit policy, it should<br>
really act with exit policy &quot;reject *:*&quot;. Fixes bug 2366.<br>
Bugfix on Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha. Bugfix by user &quot;postman&quot; on trac.</li>
<li>In the special case where you configure a public exit relay as your<br>
bridge, Tor would be willing to use that exit relay as the last<br>
hop in your circuit as well. Now we fail that circuit instead.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 2403. Reported by &quot;piebeer&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix a bug with our locking implementation on Windows that couldn&#39;t<br>
correctly detect when a file was already locked. Fixes bug 2504,<br>
bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix IPv6-related connect() failures on some platforms (BSD, OS X).<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes first part of bug 2660. Patch by<br>
&quot;piebeer&quot;.</li>
<li>Set target port in get_interface_address6() correctly. Bugfix<br>
on 0.1.1.4-alpha and 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes second part of bug 2660.</li>
<li>Directory authorities are now more robust to hops back in time<br>
when calculating router stability. Previously, if a run of uptime<br>
or downtime appeared to be negative, the calculation could give<br>
incorrect results. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha; noticed when fixing<br>
bug 1035.</li>
<li>Fix an assert that got triggered when using the TestingTorNetwork<br>
configuration option and then issuing a GETINFO config-text control<br>
command. Fixes bug 2250; bugfix on 0.2.1.2-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clients should not weight BadExit nodes as Exits in their node<br>
selection. Similarly, directory authorities should not count BadExit<br>
bandwidth as Exit bandwidth when computing bandwidth-weights.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha; fixes bug 2203.</li>
<li>Correctly clear our dir_read/dir_write history when there is an<br>
error parsing any bw history value from the state file. Bugfix on<br>
Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha.</li>
<li>Resolve a bug in verifying signatures of directory objects<br>
with digests longer than SHA1. Bugfix on 0.2.2.20-alpha.<br>
Fixes bug 2409. Found by &quot;piebeer&quot;.</li>
<li>Bridge authorities no longer crash on SIGHUP when they try to<br>
publish their relay descriptor to themselves. Fixes bug 2572. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.2.22-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Log less aggressively about circuit timeout changes, and improve<br>
some other circuit timeout messages. Resolves bug 2004.</li>
<li>Log a little more clearly about the times at which we&#39;re no longer<br>
accepting new connections. Resolves bug 2181.</li>
<li>Reject attempts at the client side to open connections to private<br>
IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1, and so on) with<br>
a randomly chosen exit node. Attempts to do so are always<br>
ill-defined, generally prevented by exit policies, and usually<br>
in error. This will also help to detect loops in transparent<br>
proxy configurations. You can disable this feature by setting<br>
&quot;ClientRejectInternalAddresses 0&quot; in your torrc.</li>
<li>Always treat failure to allocate an RSA key as an unrecoverable<br>
allocation error.</li>
<li>Update to the March 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features (log subsystem):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add documentation for configuring logging at different severities in<br>
different log domains. We&#39;ve had this feature since 0.2.1.1-alpha,<br>
but for some reason it never made it into the manpage. Fixes<br>
bug 2215.</li>
<li>Make it simpler to specify &quot;All log domains except for A and B&quot;.<br>
Previously you needed to say &quot;[*,~A,~B]&quot;. Now you can just say<br>
&quot;[~A,~B]&quot;.</li>
<li>Add a &quot;LogMessageDomains 1&quot; option to include the domains of log<br>
messages along with the messages. Without this, there&#39;s no way<br>
to use log domains without reading the source or doing a lot<br>
of guessing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stop shipping the Tor specs files and development proposal documents<br>
in the tarball. They are now in a separate git repository at<br>
git://git.torproject.org/torspec.git</li>
</ul>
