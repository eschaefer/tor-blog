          <h2>CryptoParty Stockholm</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Mar 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I attended the <a href="https://cryptoparty.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm Cryptoparty</a> on Saturday the 16th of February. I was asked to give the opening talk, &quot;Varför krypto?&quot;, to start off the day. My goal was to explain why cryptography should be used daily by everyone in mundane ways. The general topic was about how I watch kids using cryptography daily, without knowing it or without fully understanding the technical details behind it. This is ok. Kids chat a lot. When you introduce <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">Off-the-record</a> to their chats, they instantly understand that the chats are now private, and can be authenticated. The distinction between the two concepts is fairly easy to grasp, even if they don&#39;t understand the details of hashes, key exchanges, or ciphers. Once a few core people start using OTR, for example, then it spreads to their friends and soon you have networks of kids using OTR having safe and secure chats.</p>

<p>The simplest three steps people can take to begin using cryptography daily are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">https everywhere</a> in your browser.</li>
<li>Use a browser password manager. <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> is as good as any. The point is to keep username/passwords unique and complex per site/service. The next time LinkedIn or some major site loses tens of millions of passwords, you&#39;re protected because it&#39;s not the same username and password you used for your gmail, facebook, twitter, banking, and vkontact accounts.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> for actions you want to keep private. Everything on the Internet leaves a trace. The world knows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog">you&#39;re a dog</a> online.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully, I could give the introduction in English and not have to offend the attendees with my poor Swedish. Linus gave a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnkazegk89M&amp;list=UUfVxt2PKh1ANj1YlLfqJynQ&amp;index=20">Tor talk in Swedish</a>. Overall, the day went well. We had <a href="https://media.torproject.org/video/2013-02-16-cryptoparty-stockholm/PizzaLewmanNordberg3.JPG">huge pizzas</a> and generally a great time. Many people were new to cryptoparties and new to cryptography in general. It was a great time. As an American, it was nice to see about 50% women attending. There were a number of younger kids learning about all of this too. The cryptoparties I&#39;ve attended in the USA have been all men and the maybe one girlfriend or wife dragged to the event.</p>

<p>(Unfortunately, the camera recording my talk malfunctioned and corrupted the video. However, other images and videos from the day are <a href="https://media.torproject.org/video/2013-02-16-cryptoparty-stockholm/">available on our media server</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://dfri.se/">DFRI</a>, <a href="http://www.sparvnastet.org/">Sparvnästet</a>, and <a href="https://www.iis.se/">iis.se</a> for hosting the event and inviting me to attend.</p>
