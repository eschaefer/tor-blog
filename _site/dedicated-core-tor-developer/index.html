          <h2>We're looking for another dedicated core Tor developer</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Apr 2012</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Your job would be to work on all aspects of the main Tor network daemon and other open-source software. This would be a contractor position for 2012 (starting as soon as you&#39;re ready and with plenty of work to keep you busy), with the possibility of 2013 and beyond.</p>

<p>Being a core Tor developer includes triaging, diagnosing, and fixing bugs; looking for and resolving security issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on implementing new features and protocol changes at every stage from design to maintenance. We&#39;d also need help making our code more scalable, testable, and maintainable. Sometimes, we need to drop everything and scramble to implement last-minute anticensorship schemes, or to deploy urgent security updates. You&#39;d also be reviewing other people&#39;s code and designs, and looking for ways to improve it. For an idea of the breadth and depth of the work you&#39;d be doing, have a look at <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/ChangeLog">the ChangeLog file from the Tor source distribution</a>.</p>
