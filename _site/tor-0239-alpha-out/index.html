<p>Tor 0.2.3.9-alpha introduces initial IPv6 support for bridges, adds<br>
 a &quot;DisableNetwork&quot; security feature that bundles can use to avoid<br>
 touching the network until bridges are configured, moves forward on<br>
 the pluggable transport design, fixes a flaw in the hidden service<br>
 design that unnecessarily prevented clients with wrong clocks from<br>
 reaching hidden services, and fixes a wide variety of other issues.</p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.3.9-alpha - 2011-12-08</strong><br>
<strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clients can now connect to private bridges over IPv6. Bridges<br>
still need at least one IPv4 address in order to connect to<br>
other relays. Note that we don&#39;t yet handle the case where the<br>
user has two bridge lines for the same bridge (one IPv4, one<br>
IPv6). Implements parts of proposal 186.</li>
<li>New &quot;DisableNetwork&quot; config option to prevent Tor from launching any<br>
connections or accepting any connections except on a control port.<br>
Bundles and controllers can set this option before letting Tor talk<br>
to the rest of the network, for example to prevent any connections<br>
to a non-bridge address. Packages like Orbot can also use this<br>
option to instruct Tor to save power when the network is off.</li>
<li>Clients and bridges can now be configured to use a separate<br>
&quot;transport&quot; proxy. This approach makes the censorship arms race<br>
easier by allowing bridges to use protocol obfuscation plugins. It<br>
implements the &quot;managed proxy&quot; part of proposal 180 (ticket 3472).</li>
<li>When using OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later, use OpenSSL&#39;s counter mode<br>
implementation. It makes AES_CTR about 7% faster than our old one<br>
(which was about 10% faster than the one OpenSSL used to provide).<br>
Resolves ticket 4526.</li>
<li>Add a &quot;tor2web mode&quot; for clients that want to connect to hidden<br>
services non-anonymously (and possibly more quickly). As a safety<br>
measure to try to keep users from turning this on without knowing<br>
what they are doing, tor2web mode must be explicitly enabled at<br>
compile time, and a copy of Tor compiled to run in tor2web mode<br>
cannot be used as a normal Tor client. Implements feature 2553.</li>
<li>Add experimental support for running on Windows with IOCP and no<br>
kernel-space socket buffers. This feature is controlled by a new<br>
&quot;UserspaceIOCPBuffers&quot; config option (off by default), which has<br>
no effect unless Tor has been built with support for bufferevents,<br>
is running on Windows, and has enabled IOCP. This may, in the long<br>
run, help solve or mitigate bug 98.</li>
<li>Use a more secure consensus parameter voting algorithm. Now at<br>
least three directory authorities or a majority of them must<br>
vote on a given parameter before it will be included in the<br>
consensus. Implements proposal 178.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden services now ignore the timestamps on INTRODUCE2 cells.<br>
They used to check that the timestamp was within 30 minutes<br>
of their system clock, so they could cap the size of their<br>
replay-detection cache, but that approach unnecessarily refused<br>
service to clients with wrong clocks. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha, when<br>
the v3 intro-point protocol (the first one which sent a timestamp<br>
field in the INTRODUCE2 cell) was introduced; fixes bug 3460.</li>
<li>Only use the EVP interface when AES acceleration is enabled,<br>
to avoid a 5-7% performance regression. Resolves issue 4525;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.3.8-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy/anonymity features (bridge detection):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make bridge SSL certificates a bit more stealthy by using random<br>
serial numbers, in the same fashion as OpenSSL when generating<br>
self-signed certificates. Implements ticket 4584.</li>
<li>Introduce a new config option &quot;DynamicDHGroups&quot;, enabled by<br>
default, which provides each bridge with a unique prime DH modulus<br>
to be used during SSL handshakes. This option attempts to help<br>
against censors who might use the Apache DH modulus as a static<br>
identifier for bridges. Addresses ticket 4548.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features (new/different config options):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New configuration option &quot;DisableDebuggerAttachment&quot; (on by default)<br>
to prevent basic debugging attachment attempts by other processes.<br>
Supports Mac OS X and Gnu/Linux. Resolves ticket 3313.</li>
<li>Allow MapAddress directives to specify matches against super-domains,<br>
as in &quot;MapAddress *.torproject.org *.torproject.org.torserver.exit&quot;.<br>
Implements issue 933.</li>
<li>Slightly change behavior of &quot;list&quot; options (that is, config<br>
options that can appear more than once) when they appear both in<br>
torrc and on the command line. Previously, the command-line options<br>
would be appended to the ones from torrc. Now, the command-line<br>
options override the torrc options entirely. This new behavior<br>
allows the user to override list options (like exit policies and<br>
ports to listen on) from the command line, rather than simply<br>
appending to the list.</li>
<li>You can get the old (appending) command-line behavior for &quot;list&quot;<br>
options by prefixing the option name with a &quot;+&quot;.</li>
<li>You can remove all the values for a &quot;list&quot; option from the command<br>
line without adding any new ones by prefixing the option name<br>
with a &quot;/&quot;.</li>
<li>Add experimental support for a &quot;defaults&quot; torrc file to be parsed<br>
before the regular torrc. Torrc options override the defaults file&#39;s<br>
options in the same way that the command line overrides the torrc.<br>
The SAVECONF controller command saves only those options which<br>
differ between the current configuration and the defaults file. HUP<br>
reloads both files. (Note: This is an experimental feature; its<br>
behavior will probably be refined in future 0.2.3.x-alpha versions<br>
to better meet packagers&#39; needs.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try to make the introductory warning message that Tor prints on<br>
startup more useful for actually finding help and information.<br>
Resolves ticket 2474.</li>
<li>Running &quot;make version&quot; now displays the version of Tor that<br>
we&#39;re about to build. Idea from katmagic; resolves issue 4400.</li>
<li>Expire old or over-used hidden service introduction points.<br>
Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>
<li>Move the replay-detection cache for the RSA-encrypted parts of<br>
INTRODUCE2 cells to the introduction point data structures.<br>
Previously, we would use one replay-detection cache per hidden<br>
service. Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>
<li>Reduce the lifetime of elements of hidden services&#39; Diffie-Hellman<br>
public key replay-detection cache from 60 minutes to 5 minutes. This<br>
replay-detection cache is now used only to detect multiple<br>
INTRODUCE2 cells specifying the same rendezvous point, so we can<br>
avoid launching multiple simultaneous attempts to connect to it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x and earlier):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist_ensure_capacity().<br>
Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by<br>
Mansour Moufid.</li>
<li>Fix a minor formatting issue in one of tor-gencert&#39;s error messages.<br>
Fixes bug 4574.</li>
<li>Prevent a false positive from the check-spaces script, by disabling<br>
the &quot;whitespace between function name and (&quot; check for functions<br>
named &#39;op()&#39;.</li>
<li>Fix a log message suggesting that people contact a non-existent<br>
email address. Fixes bug 3448.</li>
<li>Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.<br>
Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Report a real bootstrap problem to the controller on router<br>
identity mismatch. Previously we just said &quot;foo&quot;, which probably<br>
made a lot of sense at the time. Fixes bug 4169; bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str() on an address of<br>
unknown type, we would have done a strdup() on an uninitialized<br>
buffer. Now we won&#39;t. Fixes bug 4529; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.<br>
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Correctly detect and handle transient lookup failures from<br>
tor_addr_lookup(). Fixes bug 4530; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.<br>
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Use tor_socket_t type for listener argument to accept(). Fixes bug<br>
4535; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Initialize conn-&gt;addr to a valid state in spawn_cpuworker(). Fixes<br>
bug 4532; found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.3.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a compile warning in tor_inet_pton(). Bugfix on 0.2.3.8-alpha;<br>
fixes bug 4554.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t send two ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS cells when opening a new<br>
circuit for use as a hidden service client&#39;s rendezvous point.<br>
Fixes bugs 4641 and 4171; bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha. Diagnosed<br>
with help from wanoskarnet.</li>
<li>Restore behavior of overriding SocksPort, ORPort, and similar<br>
options from the command line. Bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Build fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Properly handle the case where the build-tree is not the same<br>
as the source tree when generating src/common/common_sha1.i,<br>
src/or/micro-revision.i, and src/or/or_sha1.i. Fixes bug 3953;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code simplifications, cleanups, and refactorings:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the pure attribute from all functions that used it<br>
previously. In many cases we assigned it incorrectly, because the<br>
functions might assert or call impure functions, and we don&#39;t have<br>
evidence that keeping the pure attribute is worthwhile. Implements<br>
changes suggested in ticket 4421.</li>
<li>Remove some dead code spotted by coverity. Fixes cid 432.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha, closes bug 4637.</li>
</ul>
