<div class="event">
<p>Tor 0.2.0.32 fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages<br>
(and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller<br>
security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services,<br>
further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of<br>
other issues.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.32 - 2008-11-20<br>
Security fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; config options did not clear the<br>
supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The &quot;User&quot; option<br>
is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified<br>
user&#39;s primary group. The &quot;Group&quot; option is now ignored. For more<br>
detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL<br>
in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum<br>
and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848 and 857.</li>
<li>The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being<br>
consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its<br>
exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address<br>
the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s<br>
an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process<br>
at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major bugfixes (hidden services):</p>

<ul>
<li>When fetching v0 and v2 rendezvous service descriptors in parallel,<br>
we were failing the whole hidden service request when the v0<br>
descriptor fetch fails, even if the v2 fetch is still pending and<br>
might succeed. Similarly, if the last v2 fetch fails, we were<br>
failing the whole hidden service request even if a v0 fetch is<br>
still pending. Fixes bug 814. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>When extending a circuit to a hidden service directory to upload a<br>
rendezvous descriptor using a BEGIN_DIR cell, almost 1/6 of all<br>
requests failed, because the router descriptor has not been<br>
downloaded yet. In these cases, do not attempt to upload the<br>
rendezvous descriptor, but wait until the router descriptor is<br>
downloaded and retry. Likewise, do not attempt to fetch a rendezvous<br>
descriptor from a hidden service directory for which the router<br>
descriptor has not yet been downloaded. Fixes bug 767. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix several infrequent memory leaks spotted by Coverity.</li>
<li>When testing for libevent functions, set the LDFLAGS variable<br>
correctly. Found by Riastradh.</li>
<li>Avoid a bug where the FastFirstHopPK 0 option would keep Tor from<br>
bootstrapping with tunneled directory connections. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.5-alpha. Fixes bug 797. Found by Erwin Lam.</li>
<li>When asked to connect to A.B.exit:80, if we don&#39;t know the IP for A<br>
and we know that server B rejects most-but-not all connections to<br>
port 80, we would previously reject the connection. Now, we assume<br>
the user knows what they were asking for. Fixes bug 752. Bugfix<br>
on 0.0.9rc5. Diagnosed by BarkerJr.</li>
<li>If we overrun our per-second write limits a little, count this as<br>
having used up our write allocation for the second, and choke<br>
outgoing directory writes. Previously, we had only counted this when<br>
we had met our limits precisely. Fixes bug 824. Patch from by rovv.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Remove the old v2 directory authority &#39;lefkada&#39; from the default<br>
list. It has been gone for many months.</li>
<li>Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on<br>
sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fixes bug 862.</li>
<li>Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.8-beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor bugfixes (controller):</p>

<ul>
<li>Make DNS resolved events into &quot;CLOSED&quot;, not &quot;FAILED&quot;. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves bug 807.</li>
</ul>
