               <h2>Transparency, openness, and our 2012 financial docs</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="event">
<p>After completing the standard audit, our 2012 state and federal <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en">tax filings</a> are available. Our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/2012-annual-report">2012 Annual Report</a> is also available. We publish all of our related tax documents because we believe in transparency. All US non-profit organizations are required by law to make their tax filings available to the public on request by US citizens. We want to make them available for all.</p>

<p>Part of our transparency is simply publishing the tax documents for your review. The other part is publishing what we&#39;re <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors">working on</a> in detail. We hope you&#39;ll join us in furthering our mission (a) to develop, improve and distribute free, publicly available tools and programs that promote free speech, free expression, civic engagement and privacy rights online; (b) to conduct scientific research regarding, and to promote the use of and knowledge about, such tools, programs and related issues around the world; (c) to educate the general public around the world about privacy rights and anonymity issues connected to Internet use.</p>

<p>All of this means you can look through our <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/">source code</a>, including our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation#DesignDoc">design documents</a>, and all open tasks, enhancements, and bugs available on our <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/">tracking system</a>. Our <a href="https://research.torproject.org/">research</a> reports are available as well. From a technical perspective, all of this free software, documentation, and code allows you and others to assess the safety and trustworthiness of our research and development. On another level, we have a 10 year track record of doing high quality work, saying what we&#39;re going to do, and doing what we said.</p>

<p>Internet privacy and anonymity is more important and rare than ever. Please help keep us going through <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">getting involved</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en">donations</a>, or advocating for a free Internet with privacy, anonymity, and keeping control of your identity.</p>
