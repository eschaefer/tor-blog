          <h2>Tor Challenge 2014</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We are excited to announce the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> has just launched the second <a href="https://www.eff.org/torchallenge">Tor Challenge</a>!</p>

<p>This challenge is somewhat different from the previous edition, as there are now incentives tied to running relays for an extended period of time. The goal is to educate and encourage lots of people to setup relays, and continue to contribute throughout the year.</p>

<p>EFF will be giving out a &quot;limited-edition&quot; sticker to relay operators who keep their relay running for at least 12 months. On top of that, people running a 1MB/s+ relay for 12 months will also receive a Tor t-shirt!</p>

<p>The more high-bandwidth relays we have, the better off the network is as a whole and the more people we will be able to help stay safe and secure online; so please join the EFF &amp; the Tor Project for the 2014 Tor Challenge! Also, help us spread the word about this challenge by sharing this with others!</p>
