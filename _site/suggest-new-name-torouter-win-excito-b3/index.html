<div class="post">
<p>The Torouter is the codename for a hardware project that aims to provide users with a device that can easily be configured to run as a Tor bridge or relay. We are currently working on two devices; the <a href="https://www.excito.com/node/9">Excito B3</a> and the <a href="https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/c-5-dreamplugs.aspx">DreamPlug</a>.</p>

<p>Having two devices that are both called &quot;the Torouter&quot; can be a bit confusing, so we would like your help in renaming the Excito B3 Torouter!</p>

<p>The best suggestion will not only be the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter, but the winner will also receive an Excito B3, a Tor t-shirt and stickers. Five runners-up will receive Tor t-shirts and stickers.</p>

<p>To suggest new names for the Excito B3 Torouter, send an email to <em>tor-assistants AT torproject.org</em> with &quot;Torouter naming contest&quot; in the subject. The deadline is December 5, 2011.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We have received a lot of good naming suggestions for the Excito B3 Torouter, thank you to everyone who emailed us! We have decided that the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter is <strong>onionbox</strong> . An email has gone out to the lucky winner of a B3, a t-shirt and some stickers, as well as five-runners up who will all get t-shirts and stickers.</p>
