               <h2>Tor 0.2.2.11-alpha and 0.2.2.12-alpha are out</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Apr 2010</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.12-alpha fixes a critical bug in how directory authorities<br>
handle and vote on descriptors. It was causing relays to drop out of<br>
the consensus.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.11-alpha fixes yet another instance of broken OpenSSL libraries<br>
that was causing some relays to drop out of the consensus.</p>

<p>(Windows bundles will be available whenever Andrew gets around to making<br>
them; we&#39;re trying to stick to a policy of announcing alphas on time<br>
rather than waiting for every package.)</p>

<p>Original announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Apr-2010/msg00174.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Apr-2010/msg00174.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Apr-2010/msg00174.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.12-alpha - 2010-04-20<br>
 o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Many relays have been falling out of the consensus lately because<br>
 not enough authorities know about their descriptor for them to get<br>
 a majority of votes. When we deprecated the v2 directory protocol,<br>
 we got rid of the only way that v3 authorities can hear from each<br>
 other about other descriptors. Now authorities examine every v3<br>
 vote for new descriptors, and fetch them from that authority. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.1.23.<br>
 - Fix two typos in tor_vasprintf() that broke the compile on Windows,<br>
 and a warning in or.h related to bandwidth_weight_rule_t that<br>
 prevented clean compile on OS X. Fixes bug 1363; bugfix on<br>
 0.2.2.11-alpha.<br>
 - Fix a segfault on relays when DirReqStatistics is enabled<br>
 and 24 hours pass. Bug found by keb. Fixes bug 1365; bugfix on<br>
 0.2.2.11-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:<br>
 - Demote a confusing TLS warning that relay operators might get when<br>
 someone tries to talk to their OrPort. It is neither the operator&#39;s<br>
 fault nor can they do anything about it. Fixes bug 1364; bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.0.14-alpha.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.11-alpha - 2010-04-15<br>
 o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Directory mirrors were fetching relay descriptors only from v2<br>
 directory authorities, rather than v3 authorities like they should.<br>
 Only 2 v2 authorities remain (compared to 7 v3 authorities), leading<br>
 to a serious bottleneck. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha. Fixes bug 1324.<br>
 - Fix a parsing error that made every possible value of<br>
 CircPriorityHalflifeMsec get treated as &quot;1 msec&quot;. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.2.7-alpha. Rename CircPriorityHalflifeMsec to<br>
 CircuitPriorityHalflifeMsec, so authorities can tell newer relays<br>
 about the option without breaking older ones.<br>
 - Fix SSL renegotiation behavior on OpenSSL versions like on Centos<br>
 that claim to be earlier than 0.9.8m, but which have in reality<br>
 backported huge swaths of 0.9.8m or 0.9.8n renegotiation<br>
 behavior. Possible fix for some cases of bug 1346.</p>

<p>o Minor features:<br>
 - Experiment with a more aggressive approach to preventing clients<br>
 from making one-hop exit streams. Exit relays who want to try it<br>
 out can set &quot;RefuseUnknownExits 1&quot; in their torrc, and then look<br>
 for &quot;Attempt by %s to open a stream&quot; log messages. Let us know<br>
 how it goes!<br>
 - Add support for statically linking zlib by specifying<br>
 --enable-static-zlib, to go with our support for statically linking<br>
 openssl and libevent. Resolves bug 1358.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:<br>
 - Fix a segfault that happens whenever a Tor client that is using<br>
 libevent2&#39;s bufferevents gets a hup signal. Bugfix on 0.2.2.5-alpha;<br>
 fixes bug 1341.<br>
 - When we cleaned up the contrib/tor-exit-notice.html file, we left<br>
 out the first line. Fixes bug 1295.<br>
 - When building the manpage from a tarball, we required asciidoc, but<br>
 the asciidoc -&gt; roff/html conversion was already done for the<br>
 tarball. Make &#39;make&#39; complain only when we need asciidoc (either<br>
 because we&#39;re compiling directly from git, or because we altered<br>
 the asciidoc manpage in the tarball). Bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha.<br>
 - When none of the directory authorities vote on any params, Tor<br>
 segfaulted when trying to make the consensus from the votes. We<br>
 didn&#39;t trigger the bug in practice, because authorities do include<br>
 params in their votes. Bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha; fixes bug 1322.</p>

<p>o Testsuite fixes:<br>
 - In the util/threads test, no longer free the test_mutex before all<br>
 worker threads have finished. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.<br>
 - The master thread could starve the worker threads quite badly on<br>
 certain systems, causing them to run only partially in the allowed<br>
 window. This resulted in test failures. Now the master thread sleeps<br>
 occasionally for a few microseconds while the two worker-threads<br>
 compete for the mutex. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</p>
