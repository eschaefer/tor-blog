            <h2>tor 0.2.4.22 released</h2>
<p class="meta">04 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="event">
<p>This is a slightly belated announcement for the release of tor 0.2.4.22. Going into the future, we&#39;re planning to publish this information on the blog shortly after it is sent to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-announce">tor-announce</a>.</p>

<p>Release information is always published first on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk">tor-talk</a>.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.4.22 backports numerous high-priority fixes from the Tor 0.2.5 alpha release series. These include blocking all authority signing keys that may have been affected by the OpenSSL &quot;heartbleed&quot; bug, choosing a far more secure set of TLS ciphersuites by default, closing a couple of memory leaks that could be used to run a target relay out of RAM, and several others.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog:</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.4.22 - 2014-05-16:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Major features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Block authority signing keys that were used on authorities
vulnerable to the &quot;heartbleed&quot; bug in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160). (We
don&#39;t have any evidence that these keys _were_ compromised; we&#39;re
doing this to be prudent.) Resolves ticket 11464.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (security, OOM):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a memory leak that could occur if a microdescriptor parse
fails during the tokenizing step. This bug could enable a memory
exhaustion attack by directory servers. Fixes bug 11649; bugfix
on 0.2.2.6-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (TLS cipher selection, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>The relay ciphersuite list is now generated automatically based on
uniform criteria, and includes all OpenSSL ciphersuites with
acceptable strength and forward secrecy. Previously, we had left
some perfectly fine ciphersuites unsupported due to omission or
typo. Resolves bugs 11513, 11492, 11498, 11499. Bugs reported by
&#39;cypherpunks&#39;. Bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.</li>
<li>Relays now trust themselves to have a better view than clients of
which TLS ciphersuites are better than others. (Thanks to bug
11513, the relay list is now well-considered, whereas the client
list has been chosen mainly for anti-fingerprinting purposes.)
Relays prefer: AES over 3DES; then ECDHE over DHE; then GCM over
CBC; then SHA384 over SHA256 over SHA1; and last, AES256 over
AES128. Resolves ticket 11528.</li>
<li>Clients now try to advertise the same list of ciphersuites as
Firefox 28. This change enables selection of (fast) GCM
ciphersuites, disables some strange old ciphers, and stops
advertising the ECDH (not to be confused with ECDHE) ciphersuites.
Resolves ticket 11438.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (configuration, security):</p>

<ul>
<li>When running a hidden service, do not allow TunneledDirConns 0:
trying to set that option together with a hidden service would
otherwise prevent the hidden service from running, and also make
it publish its descriptors directly over HTTP. Fixes bug 10849;
bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (controller, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sending a garbage value to the controller when a circuit is
cannibalized. Fixes bug 11519; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (exit relay, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop leaking memory when we successfully resolve a PTR record.
Fixes bug 11437; bugfix on 0.2.4.7-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (bridge client, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid 60-second delays in the bootstrapping process when Tor is
launching for a second time while using bridges. Fixes bug 9229;
bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (relays and bridges, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Give the correct URL in the warning message when trying to run a
relay on an ancient version of Windows. Fixes bug 9393.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (compilation):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a compilation error when compiling with --disable-curve25519.
Fixes bug 9700; bugfix on 0.2.4.17-rc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downgrade the warning severity for the the &quot;md was still
referenced 1 node(s)&quot; warning. Tor 0.2.5.4-alpha has better code
for trying to diagnose this bug, and the current warning in
earlier versions of tor achieves nothing useful. Addresses warning
from bug 7164.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (log verbosity, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>When we run out of usable circuit IDs on a channel, log only one
warning for the whole channel, and describe how many circuits
there were on the channel. Fixes part of ticket 11553.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Decrease the lower limit of MaxMemInCellQueues to 256 MBytes (but
leave the default at 8GBytes), to better support Raspberry Pi
users. Fixes bug 9686; bugfix on 0.2.4.14-alpha.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation (backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Correctly document that we search for a system torrc file before
looking in ~/.torrc. Fixes documentation side of 9213; bugfix on
0.2.3.18-rc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
