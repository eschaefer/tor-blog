          <p>Tor 0.2.1.20 fixes a crash bug when you&#39;re accessing many hidden services
at once, prepares for more performance improvements, and fixes a bunch
of smaller bugs.</p>

<p>The Windows and OS X bundles also include a more recent Vidalia, and
switch from Privoxy to Polipo.</p>

<p>The OS X installers are now drag and drop. It&#39;s best to un-install
Tor/Vidalia and then install this new bundle, rather than upgrade. If
you want to upgrade, you&#39;ll need to update the paths for Tor and Polipo
in the Vidalia Settings window.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.20 - 2009-10-15
 o Major bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send circuit or stream sendme cells when our window has decreased
by 100 cells, not when it has decreased by 101 cells. Bug uncovered
by Karsten when testing the &quot;reduce circuit window&quot; performance
patch. Bugfix on the 54th commit on Tor -- from July 2002,
before the release of Tor 0.0.0. This is the new winner of the
oldest-bug prize.

<ul>
<li>Fix a remotely triggerable memory leak when a consensus document
contains more than one signature from the same voter. Bugfix on
0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Avoid segfault in rare cases when finishing an introduction circuit
as a client and finding out that we don&#39;t have an introduction key
for it. Fixes bug 1073. Reported by Aaron Swartz.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Major features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tor now reads the &quot;circwindow&quot; parameter out of the consensus,
and uses that value for its circuit package window rather than the
default of 1000 cells. Begins the implementation of proposal 168.</li>
</ul>

<p>o New directory authorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up urras (run by Jacob Appelbaum) as the seventh v3 directory
authority.

<ul>
<li>Move moria1 and tonga to alternate IP addresses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a signed/unsigned compile warning in 0.2.1.19.

<ul>
<li>Fix possible segmentation fault on directory authorities. Bugfix on
0.2.1.14-rc.</li>
<li>Fix an extremely rare infinite recursion bug that could occur if
we tried to log a message after shutting down the log subsystem.
Found by Matt Edman. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix an obscure bug where hidden services on 64-bit big-endian
systems might mis-read the timestamp in v3 introduce cells, and
refuse to connect back to the client. Discovered by &quot;rotor&quot;.
Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>We were triggering a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever
we connect via the v2 connection protocol to any relay that has
a wrong clock. Instead, we should only inform the controller when
it&#39;s a trusted authority that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix
on 0.2.0.20-rc; starts to fix bug 1074. Reported by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>We were telling the controller about CHECKING_REACHABILITY and
REACHABILITY_FAILED status events whenever we launch a testing
circuit or notice that one has failed. Instead, only tell the
controller when we want to inform the user of overall success or
overall failure. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha. Fixes bug 1075. Reported
by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn when we&#39;re using a circuit that ends with a node
excluded in ExcludeExitNodes, but the circuit is not used to access
the outside world. This should help fix bug 1090. Bugfix on
0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Work around a small memory leak in some versions of OpenSSL that
stopped the memory used by the hostname TLS extension from being
freed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Minor features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;getinfo status/accepted-server-descriptor&quot; controller
command, which is the recommended way for controllers to learn
whether our server descriptor has been successfully received by at
least on directory authority. Un-recommend good-server-descriptor
getinfo and status events until we have a better design for them.</li>

          <p>On November 2, we released Vidalia 0.2.6. Primarily a bugfix release for OS X issues. The changed items are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the erroneous comma in the default vidalia.conf in the
Mac OS X drag-and-drop bundle, since we now dump whatever the
user types into a QString rather than parsing it into a
QStringList.</li>
<li>Updated the Arabic, Russian and Slovenian translations.</li>

          <p><strong>New releases, new hires, new funding</strong>
Christian Fromme joins Tor to work on development and maintenance of the growing number of tools we’ve created over the past year. Christian is a great python hacker with a strong security mindset. He’s going to enhance and maintain the tools such as tor weather, get-tor, bridge database, tor control, tor flow, check.torproject.org, etc. Christian has been a volunteer developer for the past year helping to enhance get-tor, tor weather, and generally helping out with our python coding needs.</p>

<p>On October 10, we released Tor version 0.2.2.4-alpha. The release notes can be read at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0224-alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0224-alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0224-alpha-released</a> or below:
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix several more asserts in the circuit build times code, for example one that causes Tor to fail to start once we have accumulated 5000 build times in the state file. Bugfixes on 0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes bug 1108.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Move moria1 and Tonga to alternate IP addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Log SSL state transitions at debug level during handshake, and include SSL states in error messages. This may help debug future SSL handshake issues.</li>
<li>Add a new ”Handshake” log domain for activities that happen during the TLS handshake.</li>
<li>Revert to the ”June 3 2009” ip-to-country file. The September one seems to have removed most US IP addresses.</li>
<li>Directory authorities now reject Tor relays with versions less than 0.1.2.14. This step cuts out four relays from the current network, none of which are very big.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a couple of smaller issues with gathering statistics. Bugfixes on 0.2.2.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix two memory leaks in the error case of circuit build times parse state. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</li>
<li>Don’t count one-hop circuits when we’re estimating how long it takes circuits to build on average. Otherwise we’ll set our circuit build timeout lower than we should. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</li>
<li>Directory authorities no longer change their opinion of, or vote on, whether a router is Running, unless they have themselves been online long enough to have some idea. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Fixes bug 1023.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Revise our unit tests to use the ”tinytest” framework, so we can run tests in their own processes, have smarter setup/teardown code, and so on. The unit test code has moved to its own subdirectory, and has been split into multiple modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>On October 11, we released Tor 0.2.2.5-alpha. The release notes can be read at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0225-alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0225-alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0225-alpha-released</a> or below:
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make the tarball compile again. Oops. Bugfix on 0.2.2.4-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Move dizum to an alternate IP address.</li>
<li>Code simplifications and refactorings</li>
<li>Numerous changes, bugfixes, and workarounds from Nathan Freitas to help Tor build correctly for Android phones.</li>
</ul>

<p>On October 14th we released Vidalia 0.2.5. The release notes can be read at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-025-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-025-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-025-released</a> or below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add support in the Network settings page for configuring the Socks4Proxy and Socks5Proxy* options that were added in Tor 0.2.2.1-alpha. Patch from Christopher Davis.</li>
<li>Add a ”Automatically distribute my bridge address” checkbox (enabled by default) to the bridge relay settings options. (Ticket #524)</li>
<li>Add ports 7000 and 7001 to the list of ports excluded by the IRC category in the exit policy configuration tab. (Ticket #517)</li>
<li>Add a context menu for highlighted event items in the ”Basic” message log view that allows the user to copy the selected item text to the clipboard.</li>
<li>Maybe fix a time conversion bug that could result in Vidalia displaying the wrong uptime for a relay in the network map. Stop trying to enforce proper quoting and escaping of arguments to be given to the proxy executable (e.g., Polipo). Now the user is on their own for properly formatting the command line used to start the proxy executable. (Ticket #523)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<p>Jacob and Nathan Frietas finished development of Orbot, a tor client and relay with a graphical control interface for the Android mobile operating system. More details can be found at <a href="http://openideals.com/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/" title="http://openideals.com/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/">http://openideals.com/2009/10/22/orbot-proxy/</a>.</p>

<p>Karsten rewrote the directory archive script that evaluates whether an IP address was a relay at a given point in the past in Python.</p>

<p>Started comparing free and commercial GeoIP databases for their accuracy. It would be great if someone else (a student?) would pick up this work and move it forward.</p>

<p><strong>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.</strong></p>

Testing program updates to Tor Browser Bundle destined for the next release. The multi-protocol instant messaging client we use, Pidgin, includes voip and video chat functionality. Vidalia 0.2.5 inclusion to make the process of acquiring bridge addresses or becoming a bridge easier.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong>
The bridge distribution backend is now far more reliable than it was, and the algorithm has been retuned with design from Nick and Roger. Now the bridgedb code is much more willing to hand out a user’s first few bridges, but it is much harder to get it to hand out a whole bunch of bridges.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong>
Nick rewrote the directory authority backend code to be able to provide multiple flavors of directory info: a new flavor that can be used for low-directory-bandwidth clients, and the existing flavor to support existing clients. This is the authority-side of proposals 158 and 162; once the authorities are migrated to this, we can start rolling out the client-side. Once it’s done, the directory overhead for clients should be dramatically reduced.</p>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong>
Christian rolled out changes to the email auto-responder, get-tor, to better handle emails coming to us in various languages. 50% more emails are being answered correctly since the change.
