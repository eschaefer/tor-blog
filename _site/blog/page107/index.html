        <p><p>I was invited to attend a seminar on &quot;Seeding Tomorrow&#39;s Media: Strategies for More Effective Engagement and Investment&quot;. This invite came with an all expense paid trip to the <a href="http://sim.salzburgglobal.org/">Salzburg Global Trust</a> in Salzburg, Austria. The group was an interesting mix of &quot;new media&quot; bloggers and activists and &quot;old media&quot; foundations and journalists. We decided &quot;new media vs old media&quot; is a false dichotomy; perhaps community vs. institutionalized media is a more apt description.</p>

<p>We discussed a number of topics, however the most common was the current funding expectations from US AID, UK DFID, and a number of Foundations versus what people in each locale need and are actually looking to do. The concerns of censorship and state control of media as it moves online were discussed. Most of this group had heard of Tor, but not fully understood our role in providing the needed anonymity and privacy for journalists around the world. Entirely too many citizen and professional journalists run afoul of the apparatus of state media control too easily. These people then find themselves being censored, blocked, or worse, due to their articles appearing online; whether in blogs, newspapers, microblogging, etc.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great trip. Salzburg is beautiful. The people and content were great. This isn&#39;t the typical conference Tor attends, however any conference with intelligent conversation is a fine place to be.</p>

        <p><p>On September 25, 2009, the Great Firewall of China blocked the public list of relays and directory authorities by simple IP address blocks. Currently, about 80% of the public relays are blocked by IP address and TCP port combination. Tor users are still connecting to the network through <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">bridges</a>. At the simplest level, bridges are non-public relays that don&#39;t exit traffic, but instead send it on to the rest of the Tor network.</p>

<p>If you want to help people in China get access to the uncensored Internet, run a bridge.</p>

        <p><p><strong>New releases</strong></p>

<p>On August 4, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.7. It is updated primarily due to Firefox 3.0.13 with its ssl fixes.</p>

<p>The full changelist is:<br>
1.2.7: Released 2009-08-04</p>

<ul>
<li>update Firefox to 3.0.13 </li>
<li>add Polish translation </li>
<li>update libevent to 1.4.12 </li>
</ul>

<p>On August 19, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.8. The big changes are the inclusion of statically linked openssl dlls to resolve a few geoip lookup and functionality issues with Vidalia, and the upgrade to the new Vidalia 0.2.2.</p>

<p>The full list of updates and fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>update Torbutton to 1.2.2 </li>
<li>update Vidalia to 0.2.2 </li>
<li>compile OpenSSL 0.9.8k with Visual C to make dlls </li>
<li>update Pidgin to 2.6.1 </li>
</ul>

<p>On August 3rd, we release Vidalia 0.2.1. This is a major change in the way OS X and Windows bundles are installed, as well as many usability enhancements. This also sets the stage for a plugin-API being developed over the next few months.</p>

<p>The changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;Find Bridges Now&quot; button that will attempt to automatically<br>
download a set of bridge addresses and add them to the list of bridges<br>
in the Network settings page. </li>
<li>Add support for building with Google&#39;s Breakpad crash reporting<br>
library (currently disabled by default). </li>
<li>Show or hide the &quot;Who has used my bridge recently?&quot; link along with<br>
the other bridge-related widgets when the user toggles the relay mode<br>
in the Network settings page. (Ticket #480) </li>
<li>Tolerate bridge addresses that do not specify a port number, since Tor<br>
now defaults to using port 443 in such cases. </li>
<li>Add support for viewing the map as a full screen widget when built<br>
with KDE Marble support. </li>
<li>Compute the salted hash of the control password ourself when starting<br>
Tor, rather than launching Tor once to hash the password, parsing the<br>
output, and then again to actually start Tor. </li>
<li>Add a signal handler that allows Vidalia to clean up and exit normally<br>
when it catches a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal. (Ticket #481)</li>
<li>If the user chooses to ignore further warnings for a particular port,<br>
remove it from the WarnPlaintextPorts and RejectPlaintextPorts<br>
settings immediately. Also remember their preferences and reapply them<br>
later, even if Tor is unable to writes to its torrc.(Ticket #493) </li>
<li>Don&#39;t display additional plaintext port warning message boxes until<br>
the first visible message box is dismissed. (Ticket #493) </li>
<li>Renamed the &#39;make win32-installer&#39; CMake target to &#39;make dist-win32&#39;<br>
for consistency with our &#39;make dist-osx&#39; target. </li>
<li>Fix a couple bugs in the WiX-based Windows installer related to building<br>
a Marble-enabled Vidalia installer. </li>
<li>Write the list of source files containing translatable strings to a<br>
.pro file and supply just the .pro file as an argument to lupdate, rather<br>
than supplying all of the source file names themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>On August 14th, we release Vidalia 0.2.2. It addresses an issue with openssl which causes the geoip lookups to fail on various versions of Windows. It also switches from the Nullsoft Installer to the Microsoft System Installer for better compatibility with Microsoft Windows.<br>
There are now separate Apple OS X builds, one for PowerPC architectures and one for i386 architectures. No more Universal binary bloat to download.<br>
The changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the user clicks &quot;Browse&quot; in the Advanced settings page to locate<br>
a new torrc, set the initial directory shown in the file dialog to the<br>
current location of the user&#39;s torrc. (Ticket #505) </li>
<li>Use &#39;ditto&#39; to strip the architectures we don&#39;t want from the Qt<br>
frameworks installed into the app bundle with the dist-osx,<br>
dist-osx-bundle and dist-osx-split-bundle build targets. </li>
<li>Fix a bug in the CMakeLists.txt files for ts2po and po2ts that caused<br>
build errors on Panther for those two tools. </li>
<li>Include rebuilt OpenSSL libraries in the Windows packages that are<br>
built with the static (/MT) version of the Microsoft Visual C++<br>
Runtime. Otherwise, we would require users to install the MSVC<br>
Redistributable, which doesn&#39;t work for portable installations such as<br>
the Tor Browser Bundle. </li>
<li>Remove the NSIS file for the Vidalia installer since we now ship<br>
MSI-based installers on Windows. </li>
</ul>

<p>On August 27th, we released Vidalia 0.2.3. This fixes some more bugs with &quot;Who has used by bridge&quot; functionality and switches to Qt signals for event handling.<br>
The changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the data directory before trying to copy over the default<br>
Vidalia configuration file from inside the application bundle on Mac<br>
OS X. Affects only OS X drag-and-drop installer users without a<br>
previous Vidalia installation. </li>
<li>Change all Tor event handling to use Qt&#39;s signals and slots mechanism<br>
instead of custom QEvent subclasses. </li>
<li>Fix another bug that resulted in the &quot;Who has used my bridge?&quot; link<br>
initially being visible when the user clicks &quot;Setup Relaying&quot; from<br>
the control panel if they are running a non-bridge relay.<br>
(Ticket #509, reported by &quot;vrapp&quot;) </li>
<li>Always hide the &quot;Who has used my bridge?&quot; link when Tor isn&#39;t running,<br>
since clicking it won&#39;t return useful information until Tor actually<br>
is running. </li>
</ul>

<p>On August 9th, we released Torbutton 1.2.2.<br>
The changes and enhancements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>bugfix: Workaround Firefox Bug 440892 to prevent external apps from<br>
being launched (and thus bypassing proxy settings) without user<br>
confirmation. Independently reported by Greg Fleischer and optimist.</li>
<li>bugfix: Create a separate &quot;No Proxy For&quot; option and remove the<br>
string &quot;localhost&quot; from proxy exemptions. Prevents a theoretical<br>
proxy bypass condition discovered by optimist. Fix based on patch from<br>
optimist.</li>
<li>bugfix: bug 970: Purge undo tab list on Tor toggle.</li>
<li>bugfix: bug 1040: Scrub URLs from log level 4 and higher log messages.<br>
Mac OS writes Firefox console messages to disk by default.</li>
<li>bugfix: bug 1033: Fix FoxyProxy conflict that caused some FoxyProxy<br>
strings to fail to display.</li>
<li>misc: bug 1006: Pop up a more specific failure message for pref<br>
changing errors during Tor toggle.</li>
<li>misc: Fix a couple of strict javascript warns on FF3.5</li>
<li>misc: Add chrome url protection call to conceal other addons during<br>
non-Tor usage. Patch by Sebastian Lisken.</li>
<li>misc: Remove torbutton log system init message that may have scared some<br>
paranoids. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Architecture and technical design docs</strong></p>

<p>Update our secure updater, Thandy, to have optional BitTorrent support to distribute load spikes following new releases better. Currently, it uses the mainline BitTorrent libraries that can be installed along with Thandy, but there is also some groundwork to support other BitTorrent libraries later on.</p>

<p><strong>Advocacy and outreach.</strong></p>

<p>Andrew, Jacob, Karsten, Mike, Nick, and Roger attended the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in Seattle, WA. Details can be found at <a href="http://petsymposium.org/2009/" title="http://petsymposium.org/2009/">http://petsymposium.org/2009/</a>. Jacob, Karsten, Mike, and Roger each presented their work on Tor.</p>

<p>Jacob, Karsten, Mike, Roger, and Sebastian attended Hacking at Random 2009 in Vierhouten, Netherlands. Details of the conference can be found at <a href="https://wiki.har2009.org/page/Main_Page" title="https://wiki.har2009.org/page/Main\_Page">https://wiki.har2009.org/page/Main_Page</a>. Jacob and Roger presented about Tor.</p>

<p>Jacob attended FooCamp 2009. More details can be found at <a href="http://foocamp09.wiki.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" title="http://foocamp09.wiki.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Main\_Page">http://foocamp09.wiki.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>. Jacob presented about Tor.</p>

<p>Andrew contacted Tor relay operators that started running a relay between June 12, 2009 and July 13, 2009; ostensibly for the Iranian protest movement. Of the 37 new relays, 13 had gone offline. After contacting the relay operators, 7 of the 13 are back online.</p>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<p>On August 4, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.7. It is updated primarily due to Firefox 3.0.13 with its ssl fixes.</p>

<p>The full changelist is:<br>
1.2.7: Released 2009-08-04</p>

<ul>
<li>update Firefox to 3.0.13 </li>
<li>add Polish translation </li>
<li>update libevent to 1.4.12 </li>
</ul>

<p>On August 19, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.8. The big changes are the inclusion of statically linked openssl dlls to resolve a few geoip lookup and functionality issues with Vidalia, and the upgrade to the new Vidalia 0.2.2.</p>

<li>update Vidalia to 0.2.2 </li>
<li>compile OpenSSL 0.9.8k with Visual C to make dlls </li>
<li>update Pidgin to 2.6.1 </li>
</ul>

<p>Jacob and Steve Tyree started work on a portable Tor Browser Bundle for Apple OS X. Jacob started work on a portable Tor Browser Bundle for generic Linux. Both bundles are currently in developer testing, gearing up for an alpha release in September 2009.</p>

<p>Updated TorVM with current packages for torbutton, tor, qemu. Added geoip and pycrypto to TorVM.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<p>Continued metrics work with torperf and directory request statistics. Update bufferstats report, <a href="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buffer/bufferstats-2009-08-25.pdf" title="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buffer/bufferstats-2009-08-25.pdf">http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buffer/bufferst...</a><br>
Updated circuit window report, <a href="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/circwindow-2009-08-19.pdf" title="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/circwindow-2009-08-19.pdf">http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/circ...</a></p>

<p>updated statistics on directory requests, <a href="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/dirarch/" title="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/dirarch/">http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/dirarch/</a></p>

<p>And updated measurements on overall tor network performance, <a href="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/torperf-2009-08-24.pdf" title="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/torperf-2009-08-24.pdf">http://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/tor...</a></p>

<p>Continued work on our bandwidth node scanner to provide better extra-info for clients to make better routing decisions.</p>

<p>Added a seventh directory authority run by Jacob Appelbaum.</p>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>Christian Fromme started work on our email auto-responder, get-tor, to better handle split downloads via email.</p>

<p>Jon, our mirror volunteer, continued to contact mirrors and update their status accordingly. The net change is zero, but we added a new mirror and removed a stale mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Translation work</strong></p>

<p>Runa, our Google Summer of Code student, finished the project to allow for website content to be translated via the Tor Translation Portal, <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/" title="https://translation.torproject.org/">https://translation.torproject.org/</a>. The conversion tools are now live and Danish and Farsi are the first languages enabled in the Tor Translation Portal for testing.</p>

<p>In August, there were:</p>

<p>8 Russian updates for the website<br>
29 Polish updates for the website<br>
15 Chinese updates for the website<br>
Danish updates for Torbutton<br>
Nederlandish updates for Torbutton</p>

The website is based on a set of .wml files, but Pootle only takes files in the .pot and po format. The goal was to find a solution that would make it easy to not only translate from .wml to .po and back, but enable us to convert and keep the already translated documents.</p>

<p>The solution that I chose was to use the <a href="http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/">po4a framework</a> in a set of scripts. The first script, <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/website/trunk/wml2po.sh">wml2po.sh</a>, converts from .wml to .po and adds the correct charset, encoding and copyright holder. The script also checks to see which .po files need to be updated and which don&#39;t. The second script, <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/website/trunk/po2wml.sh">po2wml.sh</a> writes the translated documents, i.e. converts from .po back to .wml. I also documented the things one would need to know before using the scripts, as well as the process of converting already translated documents. See the <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/tools/gsoc09/HOWTO">howto</a> and the <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/tools/gsoc09/README">readme</a>.</p>

<p>The project did not come without its challenges, and it took time before I got on the right track and found a solution that everyone was happy with. I looked at different scripts and SVN hooks before I settled on having two scripts that can be run at any time by anyone. In addition to that, my mentor was travelling a lot and communication was not very frequent. However, I do feel that I learned a lot and, at the same time, the communication with other GSoC students was a great help.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m pleased with how GSoC turned out. I am looking forward to seeing my code be put to use and to start working on other projects for Tor.</p>

        <p><p>There have been some recent stories in the news about various <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2009/skanky-blogging-anonymity-and-whats-right">&quot;anonymous&quot; bloggers</a> and <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2009/splitting-digital-baby-california-court-creates-new-procedure-uncovering-anonymous-comment">commenters</a> being unmasked by court order. A business promises not to give up your identity unless forced to do so via court order. This is anonymity by policy. If a business doesn&#39;t have your identity, then there is nothing to divulge. This is anonymity by design.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/08/AR2009040803248.html">Advocates for anonymous comments</a> understand the value of being able to speak freely. However, if you&#39;re simply connecting from your home or office, parts of your identity are leaked to the site on which you commented. As shown above, you can be unmasked fairly easily. Some sites simply respond to a subpoena, others legal threats, and still others simply don&#39;t care; giving away your identity with any request. There are <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torusers">plenty of valid reasons</a> to want to protect your identity in a blog, comment, or feedback form.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve participated in &quot;anonymous reviews&quot; being conducted in a company where employees get to give their opinion on anything in the company: strategy, management, branding, etc. Human Resources rolls out the &quot;anonymous survey&quot; with great fanfare as a chance for the line employees to get their voice heard. At the same time, upper management asks IT to ascertain which IP address maps to which employee, whether connecting internally or not. Employees quickly figure out what&#39;s going on and feel undervalued and coerced into toeing the company line. And management lacks the feedback they probably should hear. In this case, anonymity by policy doesn&#39;t help anyone actually improve the company.</p>

<p>Another example is the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/iraqi-rewards-program.html">Iraqi Rewards Program</a> run by the CIA. It&#39;s designed such that concerned Iraqi&#39;s can report illegal activities and get a reward for verified intelligence. Essentially, an anonymous tip line. The issue is an Iraqi citizen will go into an Internet cafe and have an encrypted conversation with cia.gov. This is bad for the people who want to report something. An observer on the network only sees someone talking to cia.gov with encryption. A truly anonymous tip line should protect the identity of the tipster, and provide the tipster with the ability to divulge as much of their identity as comfortable.</p>

<p>The examples and news stories above show you the difference between anonymity by policy and anonymity by design. We encourage the courts to keep raising the requirements before forcing a provider to divulge your identity. We encourage companies to learn how privacy can enhance their relationship with their customers. We designed Tor such that relying on court tests and company policies isn&#39;t your only protection. Tor users and relay operators don&#39;t have the data to divulge. This is anonymity and privacy by design.</p>
