	      <p>Tor 0.2.0.26-rc (released May 13) fixes a major security vulnerability caused by a bug in Debian&#39;s OpenSSL packages. All users running any 0.2.0.x version should upgrade, whether they&#39;re running Debian or not.
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00048.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00048.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00048.html</a></p>

<p>Vidalia 0.1.3 (released May 25) adds a hidden service configuration UI designed and implemented by Domenik Bork, as well as a few other bugfixes.
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.3/CHANGELOG" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.3/CHANGELOG">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.3/CHANG...</a></p>

<p>The Tor Browser Bundle 1.0.2 (released May 3) and 1.0.3 (released May 16) include upgraded versions of Tor, Vidalia, Torbutton, and Firefox.</p>

<p>We added three new part-time developers in May. We hired Matt Edman as a part-time employee at the beginning of May, to work on Vidalia maintenance, bugfixes, and new features. We also are funding Karsten Loesing to work on making hidden service rendezvous and interaction faster, and Peter Palfrader to work on lowering the overhead of directory requests, especially during bootstrap, which should directly improve the experience for Tor users on modems or cell phones.</p>

<p>Google has agreed to give us some funding to work on auto-update for Windows. Our plan is for Vidalia to look at the majority-signed network status consensus to decide when to update and to what version (Tor already lists what versions are considered safe, in each network status document). We should actually do the update via Tor if possible, for additional privacy, and we need to make sure to check package signatures to ensure package validity. Last, we need to give the user an interface for these updates, including letting her opt to migrate from one major Tor version to the next.</p>

<p>We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website translations. Vidalia also added a Turkish translation.</p>

<p>From the Vidalia 0.1.3 ChangeLog:
&quot;If we&#39;re running Tor &gt;= 0.2.0.13-alpha, then check the descriptor annotations for each descriptor before deciding to do a geoip lookup on its IP address. If the annotations indicate it is a special purpose descriptor (e.g., bridges), then don&#39;t do the lookup at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remove the &#39;Run Tor as a Service&#39; checkbox. Lots of people seem to be clicking it even though they don&#39;t really need to, and we end up leaving them in a broken state after a reboot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only display the running relays in the big list of relays to the left of the network map. Listing a big pile of unavailable relays is not particularly useful, and just clutters up the list.&quot;</p>

<p>We worked toward a Torbutton 1.2.0rc1 release candidate, which will include support for Firefox 3 along with a huge pile of privacy-related bugfixes.</p>

<p>We spent much of the first half of May dealing with a surprise massive security vulnerability in a crypto library that comes with Debian:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html</a></p>

<p>You can read a more detailed explanation of the effects of the flaw here:
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mean-tor-clients%3F" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mean-tor-clients%3F">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mea...</a></p>

<p>Part of dealing with the flaw meant doing some quick design work so we could let new Tor users be safe without making it so old Tor users were cut off from the network:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/136-legacy-keys.txt" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/136-legacy-keys.txt">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/136-legacy-keys....</a></p>

<p>Sometime in late June or early July we will disable this workaround, meaning all the 0.2.0.x users who haven&#39;t upgraded yet will be cut off.</p>

<p>We are preparing for the Tor gathering at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in Leuven in July. This is looking like it will be the largest physical gathering of Tor developers ever -- main developers attending include Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, Jacob Appelbaum, Mike Perry, Matt Edman, Steven Murdoch, and Karsten Loesing; Tor researchers include Paul Syverson and Ian Goldberg; and we&#39;ll have 5 of our 7 Google Summer of Code students there as well.
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/events/roger%2C-nick%2C-steven%2C-matt%2C-karsten%2C-paul%2C-jacob-pets" title="https://blog.torproject.org/events/roger%2C-nick%2C-steven%2C-matt%2C-karsten%2C-paul%2C-jacob-pets">https://blog.torproject.org/events/roger%2C-nick%2C-steven%2C-matt%2C-ka...</a>
 <a href="http://petsymposium.org/2008/program.php" title="http://petsymposium.org/2008/program.php">http://petsymposium.org/2008/program.php</a></p>

<p>The upcoming TBB release in June will include optional instant messaging support via Pidgin + Off-The-Record Messaging; replace the startup batch script with an actual application (named RelativeLink), so TBB now has a helpful Tor icon rather than an ugly batch file icon; and optionally support using WinRAR to produce a self-extracting split bundle.</p>

<p>We now have a more thorough set of TBB build instructions:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/INSTALL" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/INSTALL">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/INSTALL</a></p>

<p>We also documented the build and deploy process for a new TBB version:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/DEPLOYMENT" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/DEPLOYMENT">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/DEPLOYMENT</a></p>

<p>We finished integrating a UPnP library into Vidalia. This feature allows users who want to set up a Tor relay but don&#39;t want to muck with manual port forwarding on their router/firewall to just click a button and have Vidalia interact with their router/firewall automatically. This approach won&#39;t work in all cases, but it should work in at least some. The upcoming Vidalia 0.1.4 (scheduled for June) release has folded the UPnP library and GUI changes into the main Vidalia tree, along with a &quot;test&quot; button to try speaking UPnP at the local router and tell the user whether it worked; these features will be available by default in the 0.2.0.x stable release.</p>

<p>We spent May hunting for a better online translation option, since Launchpad (intended to be used for Vidalia translation) has an ugly interface and can&#39;t handle our file formats well, and Babelzilla (intended to be used for Torbutton translation) artificially limited the number of concurrent translators we could have.</p>

<p>In early June we hit upon Pootle, which is a translation server that we host, as opposed to a shared web service that other organizations host. We&#39;ve set up a test server at <a href="http://translation.torproject.org/" title="http://translation.torproject.org/">http://translation.torproject.org/</a> and imported strings for Vidalia, Torbutton, and Torcheck. We hope to have a lot more to show here in June.</p>

	      <p>We didn&#39;t expect Tor wouldn&#39;t be blocked in China for a long time before it became true days ago.  We&#39;ve got a lot of users&#39; reports on that from different regions in China about torproject.org was blocked by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China">Great Firewall</a> system in China.  
 <a href="http://mcfreds.blogspot.com/2008/06/torprojectorg-blocked-in-china.html">McFred&#39;s Blog</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>torproject.org is the official Tor(The Onion Router) web site, found recently been blocked by China&#39;s national firewall, also known as Great Firewall.
Trace route from Beijing, China shows the destination is unreachable, seems they changed the route table on the router at IP 202.97.66.37, refuse connection to Tor web site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacky talked on his <a href="http://jcvenue.com/blog/gfw-2.html">Chinese blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just there&#39;s an online survey on Tor usage in China, I found Tor official site has been &quot;harmonized&quot; when I was curious about how it said about any news...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fons said on his &quot; <a href="http://www.chinaherald.net/2008/06/internet-censor-starts-blocking-proxies.html">China Herald</a>&quot; blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year most &#39;blocks&#39; of foreign websites had disappeared and made way for more sophisticated filtering techniques. Blocking well-known proxies seems to mean the relative tightening of the censorship at a time when China had promised more openness at the internet for its foreign guests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.alouz.com/">Zola(or Zuola)</a>, a famous Chinese activist blogger, could be the first one found our site blocked and published the news <a href="https://twitter.com/zuola/statuses/836998904">on twitter</a>. He also help build <a href="http://tor.zuo.la/">a mirror site</a> soon after that(We would love to publish any other Tor mirrors in China via your comments).  Thanks Zola and all volunteers supporting Tor.  Please kindly keep <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pVaQwN7WNlsaM7U-CLgQUJQ">taking our survey</a> on Tor usage in China.
Though Tor project official site is not as same to Tor network, this harsh action will definitely affect the future awareness of Tor as a tool to support Free Access.  It means China government is paying more attention on the technological solutions rather than merely sensitive content they care before.  The sad thing is that once a web site was put into blacklist, it&#39;s very hard to get it back.  Once again, it means how important Tor&#39;s mission is.</p>

	      <p>We&#39;re happy to announce the NLnet Foundation is funding two enhancements for the Tor software and network.</p>

<p>The two projects are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.torproject.org/projects/lowbandwidth">Tor for low-bandwidth clients</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tor anonymity system is currently only usable by internet users who have high-bandwith connections. Upon the start of the Tor client, a large file with all Tor server descriptions is being downloaded. An evolution of the Tor protocol is aimed to reduce the initial download size. The new Tor protocol version shall change the way a client receives the information for its Tor circuit setup in a way, that the initial download can be performed over a slow modem line in less then three minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.torproject.org/projects/hidserv">Speeding up Hidden Services</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tor anonymity system contains an important function that is called Tor Hidden Services, which allows users to set up anonymous information services, like websites, that can only be accessed through the Tor network and are protected against identification of the host that runs the services. Using these function, critical political and human rights information can be published in a way that protects the publisher and users of the service from repression and identification. The most critical limitation of this function is the time it takes until a Hidden Service is registered in the network and the latency of contact establishment when accessed by a user. The aim of this project is to develop the new protocol which will change the way Tor circuits are set up between the user and the Hidden Service as well as the way a Hidden Service is registered in the Tor network.</p>

	      <p>Google is funding a project to create an auto-update feature in Vidalia. This <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/google">auto-update feature</a> will provide a better user experience for Tor users. The goal is to create a system where Vidalia can detect when a new release is available, fetch the package, verify authenticity, and assist the user in upgrading the Vidalia/Tor package. The auto-update feature preserves the user&#39;s privacy and anonymity. Over the next six months we&#39;ll develop the auto-update system for general release around November 15, 2008.</p>

<p>We&#39;re excited to work with Google on this project and look forward to the collaboration.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Here&#39;s a timely reminder of why anonymous publishing tools like Tor
are so critical to free expression. A recent book, <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2008/05/22/risking_executio.php">Anonymity: A Secret History of English Literature</a>, covers the history of anonymous publication in English literature, noting that many authors and publishers were imprisoned, tortured, or killed for expressing politically unpopular views.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Risking execution
In the current London Review of Books <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n10/eagl01_.html%20">Terry Eagleton writes</a> on the history of publishing books anonymously:</p>

<p>There were … legal and political reasons for the ubiquity of Anon. There were times when the state needed to know the author or printer of a work in order to know who to prosecute for heresy or sedition. In 1579, John Stubbs had his right hand cut off for writing a work opposing the marriage of Elizabeth I to a French nobleman. Elizabeth herself urged that the printers of the anti-Anglican Marprelate tracts should be subjected to torture. In 1663, a London printer who published a pamphlet which argued that the monarch should be accountable to his subjects, and justified the people’s right to rebellion, was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He refused, even so, to reveal the name of the pamphlet’s author, though the disclosure might have saved his life. Between the 16th and the 18th century, printers were fined, imprisoned and pilloried for publishing supposedly treasonable works whose authors remained concealed. Being Jonathan Swift’s printer was not a job for the faint-hearted.</p>

<p>Looking for modern parallels, can you imagine the head of an ISP risking execution to defend the anonymity of a person publishing something via their servers when a government or company takes exception to it?</p>

<p>I know, ISPs rightly try to avoid being classed as “publishers”, but they’re still the ones offended parties go to to halt online “publication” or reveal authorial identity. I guess a closer parallel would be the owner of a website risking execution to safeguard the identity of a writer whose work they’d knowingly published on their site. Actually, the closest modern day parallel is, duh, a book
publisher, but that doesn’t seem much more likely a situation either.</p>
