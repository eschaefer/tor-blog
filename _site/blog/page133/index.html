        <p><p>Tor 0.2.0.20-rc (released Feb 24) is the first release candidate for the 0.2.0 series. It makes more progress towards normalizing Tor&#39;s TLS handshake, makes hidden services work better again, helps relays bootstrap if they don&#39;t know their IP address, adds optional support for linking in openbsd&#39;s allocator or tcmalloc, allows really fast relays to scale past 15000 sockets, and fixes a bunch of minor bugs reported by Veracode.<br>
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00279.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00279.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00279.html</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha (released Feb 9) makes more progress towards normalizing Tor&#39;s TLS handshake, makes path selection for relays more secure and IP address guessing more robust, and generally fixes a lot of bugs in preparation for calling the 0.2.0 branch stable.<br>
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00134.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00134.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2008/msg00134.html</a></p>

<p>Torbutton 1.1.13 (released Feb 1), 1.1.14 (released Feb 24), and 1.1.15 (released Feb 26) fix many more potential privacy and identity leaks, mostly based on exploits found by Greg Fleischer. They also add support for automatic updates via the usual Firefox extension upgrade approach.<br>
 <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG" title="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG">https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<p>Work continued toward the upcoming Vidalia 0.1.0 release (which came out March 1): support for launching Firefox and Polipo as supporting applications; support for learning from Tor when the first circuit is ready so it can inform the user; and many other bugfixes including a few security fixes.<br>
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/releases/vidalia-0.1.0/CHANGELOG" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/releases/vidalia-0.1.0/CHANGELOG">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/releases/vidalia-0.1.0/C...</a></p>

<p>The Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha release contained many security-related cleanups based on an anonymously submitted code review from a static analysis tool. The Tor 0.2.0.20-rc release contained even more security-related cleanups, based on an external security analysis and audit by Veracode. Hopefully cleanups at this stage will reduce the number of times we need to push out an urgent new stable &quot;0.2.0&quot; release for security reasons.</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“When connecting to a bridge without specifying its key, insert the connection into the identity-to-connection map as soon as a key is learned. This prevents the Tor user&#39;s log from showing a confusing complaint periodically.”<br>
“When our consensus networkstatus has been expired for a while, stop being willing to build circuits using it. Now clients won&#39;t give themselves away by behaving uniquely if they start up with an old networkstatus view.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.20-rc ChangeLog:<br>
“Choose which bridge to use proportional to its advertised bandwidth, rather than uniformly at random. This should speed up Tor for bridge users. Also do this for people who set StrictEntryNodes.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“If we&#39;re a relay, avoid picking ourselves as an introduction point, a rendezvous point, or as the final hop for internal circuits.”<br>
“Directory caches now fetch certificates from all authorities listed in a networkstatus consensus, even when they do not recognize them. This bugfix is particularly important for bridge users, since the bridges are their only contact point for fetching new directory information.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.20-rc ChangeLog:<br>
“Servers that don&#39;t know their own IP address should go to the authorities for their first directory fetch, even if their DirPort is off or if they don&#39;t know they&#39;re reachable yet. This will help them bootstrap better.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.20-rc ChangeLog:<br>
“We were comparing the raw BridgePassword entry with a base64&#39;ed version of it, when handling a &quot;/tor/networkstatus-bridges&quot; directory request. Now compare correctly. This bugfix should allow bridge communities (formerly known as bridge families) to work better. Noticed by Veracode.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“Do not include recognizeable strings in the commonname part of Tor&#39;s x509 certificates.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.20-rc ChangeLog:<br>
“Enable the revised TLS handshake based on the one designed by Steven Murdoch in proposal 124, as revised in proposal 130. It includes version negotiation for OR connections as described in proposal 105. The new handshake is meant to be harder for censors to fingerprint, and it adds the ability to detect certain kinds of man-in-the-middle traffic analysis attacks. The version negotiation feature will allow us to improve Tor&#39;s link protocol more safely in the future.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.20-rc ChangeLog:<br>
“Tune parameters for cell pool allocation to minimize amount of RAM overhead used.”<br>
“Add OpenBSD malloc code from phk as an optional malloc replacement on Linux: some glibc libraries do very poorly with Tor&#39;s memory allocation patterns. Pass --enable-openbsd-malloc to get the replacement malloc code.”<br>
“Stop imposing an arbitrary maximum on the number of file descriptors used for extremely high-throughput servers. Bug reported by Olaf Selke; patch from Sebastian Hahn.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.19-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“Patch from &quot;Andrew S. Lists&quot; to catch when we contact a directory mirror at IP address X and he says we look like we&#39;re coming from IP address X. This was causing some Tor relays to test their reachability by testing the wrong address, and never actually publish to the main list.”</p>

<p>We cleaned up the Tor Browser Bundle&#39;s webpage and instructions based on feedback from users who were visiting Iran and Burma. Also started preparations to make it easy for our translators to provide an alternate languages. As of March 10, we have English, German, Italian, Polish, and Russian translations. We are working to coordinate an Arabic translation too.<br>
 <a href="https://torbrowser.torproject.org/" title="https://torbrowser.torproject.org/">https://torbrowser.torproject.org/</a></p>

<p>The new Tor Browser Bundle 0.0.7 (released Feb 8) and 0.0.8 (released Feb 15) include security updates for Firefox (2.0.12), security updates for Torbutton (1.1.13), automate generation of internationalized bundles, allow optional extensions to be placed in build-scripts/extensions, build Polipo with regular expression support (activating the forbiddenFile option), and update Polipo configuration based on suggestions from Incognito&#39;s Polipo configuration:<br>

        <p><p>In Tor&#39;s annual board meeting in January, we added <a href="http://www.isaacmao.com/meta/">Isaac Mao</a> to our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/people#Board">board of directors</a>. Isaac is a well-known blogger, especially among the Chinese blogging community, and adding him is the first part of our push to make the Tor board (and The Tor Project in general) more international in scope and awareness.</p>

<p>Isaac will take over Rebecca McKinnon&#39;s spot on the board, though Rebecca is planning to stick around and continue helping with advice about how to interact with the media and Tor&#39;s role in society, especially in Asia. Isaac has a lot of ideas about how to make Tor easier to use and how to get the word out to all the different groups that need it. We&#39;re looking forward to working with him!</p>

        <p><p>Tor 0.2.0.18-alpha (released Jan 25) adds a sixth v3 directory authority run by CCC, fixes a big memory leak in 0.2.0.17-alpha, and adds new config options that can warn or reject connections to ports generally associated with vulnerable-plaintext protocols.<br>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.16-alpha and 0.2.0.17-alpha (released Jan 17) add a fifth v3 directory authority run by Karsten Loesing, and generally clean up a lot of features and minor bugs.<br>

<p>Tor 0.1.2.19 (released Jan 17) fixes a huge memory leak on exit relays, makes the default exit policy a little bit more conservative so it&#39;s safer to run an exit relay on a home system, and fixes a variety of smaller issues.<br>
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2008/msg00000.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2008/msg00000.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Jan-2008/msg00000.html</a></p>

<p>We continued work on the &quot;BridgeDB&quot; module: major progress on January was to improve robustness of the email subsystem so it is better at detecting forged mails that claim to be from gmail but are actually from elsewhere.</p>

<p>Work continued toward the upcoming Torbutton 1.1.13 release (which came out Feb 1). This new release has several significant security-related fixes:<br>
 <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG" title="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG">https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<p>Work continued toward the upcoming Vidalia 0.1.0 release: support for launching Firefox and Polipo as supporting applications; support for learning from Tor when the first circuit is ready so it can inform the user; and many other bugfixes including a few security fixes:<br>
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/CHANGELOG" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/CHANGELOG">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<p>We added a &quot;How do I find a bridge?&quot; link and corresponding help text to Vidalia&#39;s &#39;Network&#39; settings page.</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.16-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“Do not try to download missing certificates until we have tried to check our fallback consensus.” This change gets us closer to being able to bootstrap without ever needing to contact the central directory authorities.</p>

<p>New proposal &quot;Version 2 Tor connection protocol&quot; that specifies the details of our proposed new TLS handshake and how it interacts with current clients and servers:<br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/130-v2-conn-protocol.txt" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/130-v2-conn-protocol.txt">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/130-v2-conn-prot...</a></p>

<p>New proposal &quot;Block Insecure Protocols by Default&quot; in collaboration with researchers at University of Colorado to warn and/or refuse users when they try to use ports commonly associated with vulnerable-plaintext protocols:<br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/129-reject-plaintext-ports" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/129-reject-plaintext-ports">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/129-reject-plain...</a></p>

<p>Implemented in Tor 0.2.0.18-alpha:<br>
“New config options WarnPlaintextPorts and RejectPlaintextPorts so Tor can warn and/or refuse connections to ports commonly used with vulnerable-plaintext protocols. Currently we warn on ports 23, 109, 110, and 143, but we don&#39;t reject any.”</p>

<p>Started work on a roadmap of all the future features and extensions we know we need. It&#39;s still mostly in outline form at this point:<br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/design-paper/roadmap-future.pdf" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/design-paper/roadmap-future.pdf">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/design-paper/roadmap-future.pdf</a></p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.18-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“If we&#39;ve gone 12 hours since our last bandwidth check, and we estimate we have less than 50KB bandwidth capacity but we could handle more, do another bandwidth test.” Bridge relays that weren&#39;t getting any use were seeing their bandwidth estimate fall to 0 after the first few days of uptime.</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.16-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“Make bridges round reported GeoIP stats info up to the nearest multiple of 8, not down. Now we can distinguish between &quot;0 people from this country&quot; and &quot;1 person from this country&quot;, without needing to collect precise statistics.”<br>
“Bridge authorities are no longer willing to serve bridge descriptors over unencrypted connections.” This will discourage people from writing tools that don&#39;t bother using encrypted connections.</p>

<p>We continued to deploy the new design for the normalized TLS handshake. Thanks to some assistance from an OpenSSL development team member, we were able to get closer to completing a new version-2 style TLS handshake. In early February we have successfully made such a handshake: so we expect that February will be the month when this feature finally rolls out.</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.1.2.19 ChangeLog:<br>
“Exit policies now reject connections that are addressed to a relay&#39;s public (external) IP address too, unless ExitPolicyRejectPrivate is turned off. We do this because too many relays are running nearby to services that trust them based on network address.” This change will allow more people to run relays comfortably, thus expanding the network.<br>
“Stop thinking that 0.1.2.x directory servers can handle &quot;begin_dir&quot; requests. Should ease bugs 406 and 419 where 0.1.2.x relays are crashing or mis-answering these types of requests.”<br>
“Fix a memory leak on exit relays; we were leaking a cached_resolve_t on every successful resolve. Reported by Mike Perry.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.16-alpha ChangeLog:<br>
“Major performance improvement: Switch our old ring buffer implementation for one more like that used by free Unix kernels. The wasted space in a buffer with 1MB of data will now be more like 8KB than 1MB. The new implementation also avoids realloc();realloc(); patterns that can contribute to memory fragmentation.”</p>

<p>The Tor Browser Bundle now has its own webpage, complete with an installation guide and screenshots:<br>
 <a href="https://torbrowser.torproject.org/" title="https://torbrowser.torproject.org/">https://torbrowser.torproject.org/</a></p>

<p>The new 0.0.6 Tor Browser Bundle (released Jan 29) includes Polipo, includes a newer Tor release, and fixes a few configuration aspects to make it more secure:<br>

<p>A new version of the Incognito Privacy LiveCD was released on Jan 26. It includes new versions of many components, and also some bugfixes on the USB support:<br>
