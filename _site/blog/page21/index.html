	      <p>Welcome to the twenty-fourth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Introducing a new Lead Automation Engineer</h1>

<p>The Tor Project welcomed a new member, Nicolas Vigier, in the role of Lead Automation Engineer. He swiftly got down to business by <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005906.html">putting out a call</a> for automation-related feedback “from developers of any tor components”, promising a summary of “the current status regarding build, packaging, testing, and what should be done” to improve the automated processes involved in Tor development, as well as “some proposals and a general plan for the work to be done during the coming months”, an <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eboklm/automation/tor-automation-review.html">early version of which is already online</a>. A warm welcome to him!</p>

<h1>Freedom of the Press Foundation launch a support campaign for Tor</h1>

<p>In his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000396.html">report for November</a>, Roger Dingledine wrote: “We&#39;ve also been pondering lately how to do a fundraising or donations drive, to help move us off our reliance on government funders.” The good news is that Tor has many supporters.</p>

<p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation just started <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2013/12/freedom-press-foundation-launches-campaign-support-encryption-tools-journalists">a campaign to support encryption tools for journalists</a> that is going to last for two months. The campaign is gathering funds for Tor core development work, the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails live system</a>, the encrypted mobile communication tools <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">RedPhone and TextSecure</a>, and the encrypted email platform <a href="https://leap.se/">LEAP</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/">Spread the word</a> and help make the campaign a success. Direct <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/">donations to The Tor Project</a> are also always possible.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for November 2013</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of November continued, with reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000396.html">Roger Dingledine</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000397.html">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000398.html">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000399.html">Matt Pagan</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000400.html">Nicolas Vigier</a> <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000401.html">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000402.html">Damian Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000403.html">Noel David Torres Taño </a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>David Fifield has produced <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/pluggable-transports-bundles-2418-rc-1-pt1-and-2418-rc-2-pt1-firefox-17011esr">updated “pluggable transport bundles”</a> based on the 2.4.18 browser bundles. Be sure to upgrade!</p>

<p>David also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005913.html">announced</a> great progress in integrating our current set of pluggable transports within the new Tor Browser 3 build infrastructure.</p>

<p>Thanks to Himanshu from India, Andrew Lewman was able to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-December/000394.html">deploy a new script</a> to list <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors.html.en">mirrors of the Tor Project&#39;s website</a>. The new code will ensure that mirrored files are “100% the same as those on torproject.org (hashing, pgp signatures, etc)” and will remove and re-instate mirrors accordingly.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-October/000381.html">BarkerJr</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-November/000384.html">DevRandom</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-November/000389.html">Userzap</a> for setting up new mirrors!</p>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031331.html">announced that Orfox was going to replace Orweb</a> in the Guardian Project set of secure communication tools. Orfox is based on the Firefox engine and is likely to behave more like the Tor Browser. “However, Orfox is still very early (not alpha yet) and has not been fully tested. I would either do your own testing and report back to us, or only use the app for non sensitive/critical browsing for now”, Nathan <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031340.html">added</a>.</p>

<p>arkmd <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005901.html">reported</a> that TorBirdy was saving unencrypted drafts on the remote server on their system. Sukhbir Singh has <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10309#comment:4">not been able to reproduce the issue so far</a> but he is thinking of <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005903.html">disabling the automatic save feature entirely</a>.</p>

<p>Christian <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031353.html">announced</a> that Globe is “now officially hosted on the torproject servers”. Credits to Karsten Loesing and Peter Palfrader for setting up the infrastructure. Have a look at this <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">new Tor relay and bridge explorer</a>!</p>

<p>ghostmaker <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005908.html">advertised</a> “a small new tool for Windows called InjectSOCKS that can force other Windows software to do TCP connections via SOCKS.” InjectSOCKS source code and binaries are available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/injectsocks">the project page</a>.</p>

<p>The Tails team has issued a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_incremental_upgrades/">call for testing regarding incremental upgrades</a> — one more step on the path to providing Tails users with easy upgrades.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004405.html">release schedule for Tails 0.22.1</a> has been published by intrigeri. The expected release date for this point release is January 21th.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Multiple users have asked the help desk specifically for assistance with IPv6 bridges. Currently getting IPv6 bridges is not too easy, but the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9127">issue is known</a> and should be solved as the bridge distributor is improved. IPv6 bridges are functional in (at least part of) China, but we do not have many of them to distribute. Please set up an IPv6 bridge if you can: it&#39;s only <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Elinus/ipv6-relay-howto.html">one “ORPort” line to add</a> to the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#RunningABridge">usual configuration</a>.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the twenty-third issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Next-Generation Hidden Services reach draft proposal state</h1>

<p>Nick Mathewson has been working on turning a “revamp of the hidden services protocol” into a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/001-process.txt">formal proposal</a>. Last Saturday, Nick blessed the tor-dev mailing list with a post of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005877.html">current draft for proposal 224</a>, dubbed “Next-Generation Hidden Services in Tor”.</p>

<p>Nick currently lists 25 different people who made writing the new proposal possible, and there will be probably some more to add before the proposal reaches completion. We will spare the reader a full list, but <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tor-weekly-news">Tor Weekly News’ archives</a> attest that George Kadianakis deserves a special mention for his repeated efforts to move things forward.</p>

<p>The proposal aims to replace “the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/rend-spec.txt">current rend-spec.txt</a>, rewritten for clarity and for improved design.” The most user visible change from the current hidden services protocol is the new address format. In order to prevent the enumeration of hidden services, the new protocol derives a “blinded key” (section 1.3) from an Ed25519 master identity key. The blinding operation operates on the full key (and not just a truncated hash, as before). With a base 32 encoding of the entire 256 bits (section 1.2), “a new name following this specification might look like: <code>a1uik0w1gmfq3i5ievxdm9ceu27e88g6o7pe0rffdw9jmntwkdsd.onion</code>”. Other encodings might still be worth consideration as long as they make valid hostnames.</p>

<p>Less visible changes include the departure from RSA1024, DH1024, and SHA1 to prefer Ed25519, Curve25519, and SHA256 as the cryptographic primitives (section 0.3).</p>

<p>The selection of directories responsible for a hidden service will now depend on a periodic “collaboratively generated random value” provided by the Tor directory authorities. This way the directories of a hidden service are not predictable in advance, which prevents targeted denial of service attacks (see <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/8244">ticket #8244</a> and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/225-strawman-shared-rand.txt">proposal 225</a> for a possible scheme).</p>

<p>The new proposal also introduces the possibility of keeping the master identity key offline (section 1.7).</p>

<p>The proposal is completely unfinished when it comes to scaling hidden services to multiple hosts (section 1.5). There have been <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005556.html">discussions on this topic</a>, but there is no final decision on what the final scheme should be. The problem with naive scaling schemes is that information about the number of hidden service nodes can leak to adversarial clients or introduction points.</p>

<p>In order to move the proposal forward from the current draft, Nick Mathewson told the readers: “I’d like to know what doesn’t make sense, what I need to explain better, and what I need to design better. I’d like to fill in the gaps and turn this into a more full document. I’d like to answer the open questions. Comments are most welcome, especially if they grow into improvements.” The document is still sprinkled with many TODO items, so feel free to jump in if you want to help!</p>

<h1>Tor relay operators meeting at 30C3</h1>

<p>Moritz Bartl <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-December/003449.html">announced</a> that a meeting of Tor relay operators and organizations will be held as part of the first day of the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg on the 27th December. He asked major relay operators and Torservers.net partner organizations to prepare some slides explaining their activities; the German partner organization, Zwiebelfreunde e.V., will hold its own meeting directly afterwards.</p>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of November has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000387.html">Pearl Crescent</a> released their report first , followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000388.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000389.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000390.html">Colin C.</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000391.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000393.html">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000394.html">Arlo Breault</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000395.html">Ximin Luo</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.22-rc1/">first release candidate for Tails 0.22</a> is out. The new version features a browser based on Firefox 24 and has reached beta stage for incremental updates, among other things. Tests are most welcome, as always!</p>

<p>The Tails team called for translators to help with the strings both <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-December/000774.html">for Tails 0.22</a>, as well as <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-November/000771.html">for the new incremental upgrade software</a>. The strings for translation are now available in the <a href="https://git-tails.immerda.ch/iuk/">Tails Git repository</a>, and hopefully should also be up <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/">on Transifex</a> soon.</p>

<p>Damian Johnson sent out a link to a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005867.html">recording of his talk on the Tor ecosystem</a> at TA3M in Seattle.</p>

<p>David Goulet <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005870.html">called for assistance</a> with the code-review process for the Torsocks 2.0 release candidate, and offered some guidance on where to begin.</p>

<p>Erinn Clark and Peter Palfrader <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005871.html">upgraded the Tor Bug Tracker &amp; Wiki to Trac version 1.0</a>.</p>

<p>intrigeri <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-November/004353.html">began</a> compiling a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/glossary/">glossary</a> of words that Tails and its developers use for particular concepts, to assist contributors who might not be familiar with these special meanings.</p>

<p>In order to remove “a full database of relays on our already overloaded metrics machine”, Karsten Loesing is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031310.html">asking for those using the “relay-search service” to speak up</a> before the decommissioning of the service by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Philipp Winter followed up on his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005863.html">experiments in exit scanning</a>and released <a href="https://github.com/NullHypothesis/exitmap">exitmap</a>, which uses Stem to control the tor daemon in creating circuits to all exit nodes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.subgraph.com/orchid.html">Orchid</a>, a Tor client implementation written in pure Java, silently reached the 1.0 milestone on November 27th. Nathan Freitas is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005884.html">looking for comment</a> from the community as he is “thinking about having Orbot use it by default, and then offering ARM and x86 binaries as add-on enhancements.” His main argument is that it “would make the core Tor on Android experience more lightweight for client only use.”</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation helped a student group in Iowa convince their university that they should be allowed to hold discussions about Tor on campus. The EFF’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/open-letter-urging-universities-encourage-conversation-about-online-privacy">open letter to universities</a> and their <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/tor-myths-and-facts">“Myths and Facts About Tor”</a> document make useful advocacy material.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Multiple users asked about using Tor for PC gaming. Tor can only transport TCP, which is how web pages are transmitted. Many video games rely on UDP or other protocols to transport data because of the lower latency. Information these games transport over protocols besides TCP would not be sent over Tor. Also any software used with Tor needs to be tested for proxy obedience. Untested applications might send information without using Tor even if they appear to be configured correctly, and
without the user realizing it.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the twenty-second issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Round of updated Tor Browser Bundles</h1>

<p>Mozilla put out an <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0.11/releasenotes/">urgent security release</a> of the stable Firefox branch with version 17.0.11esr. The <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-firefox-17011esr-and-tor-02418-rc">stable version of the Tor Browser Bundle has been updated</a> accordingly. The 2.4 release candidate also received an update, together with the latest incarnation of tor 0.2.4.18-rc. Both were then given <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/64-bit-gnulinux-tor-browser-bundles-updated">a further update</a> due to an issue on 64 bit GNU/Linux systems.</p>

<p>The 3.0 branch saw the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30rc1-released">release of 3.0rc1</a> which — on top of updating its base software — fixed a build reproducibility issue on Windows, and a few other small fixes.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-November/004152.html">updated version of Tails</a> and the pluggable transport bundle are still in the making at the time of writing.</p>

<h1>Tor is looking for a Browser Hacker and an Extension Developer!</h1>

<p>Mike Perry <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-looking-browser-hacker-and-extension-developer">wrote a blog post</a> to announce two new positions available at the Tor Project: “We are looking for a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html">C++ browser developer</a> to work on our Firefox-based browser, and a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-extdev.html.en">Firefox extension developer</a> to work on our growing number of Firefox extensions. Our ideal candidates would be comfortable in both roles, but we are also interested in hearing from people with either skillset.”</p>

<p>Look at the job descriptions for more details and how to apply for these exciting opportunities to make Tor software even better.</p>

<h1>“Safeplug”</h1>

<p>Roman Mamedov <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031199.html">reported</a> that the Californian company Cloud Engines is now shipping a device called the “Safeplug”. Exactly how the device works is unclear, but according to their FAQ, it looks like a router which transparently directs its client connections through Tor.</p>

<p>Such an approach is known to be flawed. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031200.html">Sean Alexandre</a> was prompt in reminding everyone that “application protocols can still reveal your identity”, and quoted the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#warning">warning on Tor’s download page</a>: “To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you’re browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.”</p>

<p>Aaron Gibson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031215.html">detailed other concerns</a>, namely the absence of source code or design documents, the mandatory router registration procedure, issues with the automatic update system, and the terms of service. He also criticized the “torified everything” approach and outlined an alternative which he had discussed with Roger Dingledine: “providing a captive portal that would instruct a user to download a copy of TBB and use the local router device as a first hop into the Tor network, perhaps by configuring the device as a bridge.”</p>

<p>On the upside, Andrew Lewman <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031204.html">views the product</a> as “a fine test case for consumer-level torouter market analysis. It would be great to learn 6 months from now how many they sold and a summary of customer feedback.” Despite having “ <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031235.html">lots of concerns</a>”, Andrew is “trying to discuss them with Cloud Engines” and praised the community for “doing a fine job of raising questions”.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005836.html">gave the number 223</a> to Esfandiar Mohammadi’s proposal titled “ <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/223-ace-handshake.txt">Ace: Improved circuit-creation key exchange</a>”.</p>

<p>Matt Pagan <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000385.html">reported</a> on his trip to Washington, D.C., USA for the Rally Against Mass Surveillance. He gave an account of his talk during the cryptoparty and the march that happened the next day.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò sent his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000386.html">report</a> about his activities in October.</p>

<p>Nathan Freitas reported on his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005857.html">efforts to use GeckoView on Android 4.4</a>, which can be seen as the “first step towards Tor Browser on Android”.</p>

<p>Kevin Dyer <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005861.html">announced</a> a new release of a <a href="https://fteproxy.org/">pluggable transport powered by Format-Transforming Encryption</a>. Cross-platform builds of the pluggable transport Tor Browser Bundle are available for download for the adventurous.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Echoing the tor-talk thread summarized above, multiple people asked whether or not the Tor Project could recommend the Safeplug device.</p>

<p>An OS X user asked if it was always necessary to open the Tor Browser folder in order to start the Tor Browser Bundle. It is possible to create an alias in Mac OS or a shortcut in Windows to the “Start Tor Browser” script and place that alias or shortcut in a convenient place,
such as the Desktop.</p>
