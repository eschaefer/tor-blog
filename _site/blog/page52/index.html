          <p><p>The Tor translation glossary is a glossary used primarily when <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/torproject/">translating</a> software and documentation for the Tor Project. This glossary contains technical, general, gui and Tor specific terms, as well as names. This glossary can also be used for a more consistent use of technical terms in the source language (English).</p>

<p>Translators can access this glossary from inside Transifex when working on a resource. To view the glossary for a specific language, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/torproject/">our project page</a> on Transifex</li>
<li>Choose the language</li>
<li>Choose the resource</li>
<li>In the box that pops up, click <em>Translate Now</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a link to the translation glossary right above the source strings and translations, along with a search box and a set of shortcuts. Please help translate the glossary to ensure that translations in your language are consistent across different resources.</p>

          <p><p>Hi all. A new release of <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> is now available which includes <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/releaseNotes.php">numerous fixes</a> of mounting importance. In particular this corrects several issues around arm&#39;s connection panel, terminal glitches due to <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/arm.git/commitdiff/b86e5bf">disruption of the curses module by readline</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-April/023961.html">incompatibility with tor&#39;s new development releases</a>.</p>

<p>This release does not include any new features, nor are any planned in the near future. Most of my attention is going to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/stem">stem</a> right now, and my next foray into arm will be to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/gsocProposal/gsoc12-proposal-stemImprovements.html">work with Ravi</a> to migrate it to the new library this summer. That said, if you encounter any problems then let me know! -Damian</p>

          <p><p>The Tor Browser Bundles have all been updated to the latest Firefox 12.0 as well as a number of other software updates, bugfixes, and new features. We&#39;ve rebranded Firefox so it should now be more easy to distinguish between it and your normal Firefox. We&#39;ve also added Korean and Vietnamese to the available languages.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Mac OS X 64-bit bundles had a minor Vidalia problem that prevented TorBrowser from being launched. They have been updated to 2.2.35-9.1 and are now available on the website.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

          <p><p>The internet agency Hadara is restricting access to certain content for users in Bethlehem, Palestine. The content of the websites in question appears to be in support of Muhammad Dahlan, the former leader of Fatah.</p>

<p>The Hadara network in Palestine is using a transparent HTTP proxy to inspect content and to censor the content of specific sites. A transparent HTTP proxy intercepts all of the customer&#39;s access attempts, technically the HTTP requests being done on the network by the customer&#39;s browser, and then the proxy makes requests in place of the client. Sometimes this is a good thing, especially on congested networks or very expensive network connections. This is useful because the proxy can serve the cached version of the requested object if it already has the most up to date version of the requested page; therefore an ISP may minimize the amount of traffic that needs to leave it&#39;s network. Sometimes it&#39;s a bad thing, such as when the ISP censors access to an otherwise normally available resource.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve found that the Hadara transparent HTTP proxy is not being used simply to decrease webpage loading times or to reduce costs. It is also being used to censor access and to block content. The <a href="http://ooni.nu">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a> ( <a href="http://ooni.nu/">OONI</a>), did a scan of over 1 million websites to understand which ones where being censored and which were freely accessible.</p>

<p>The OONI scanning techniques involved connecting to a known good HTTP server and making HTTP GET requests. Each GET request contained specially crafted Host header field that contained a given possibly blocked website. These requests were intercepted by the transparent HTTP proxy and when the site was present inside of the blocklist, it would return an error page, rather than the expected content.</p>

<p>In each case of a blocked page, the error page would be served immediately (without requiring a connection to the outside network) it was possible to parallelize a large amount of simultaneous connections and to set a very low timeout value. Because of this we were able to probe access for the Alexa top 1 million domains in less than 7 days.</p>

<p>At the moment there has not been any official response from the ISP in question and the actors responsible for the censorship have not come out. We believe that the access to information is an intrinsic human right and measures that limit people ability to read should be fought.</p>

<p>For more technical details check out <a href="http://ooni.nu/releases/2012/Hadara_Palestine.html">the full report on the OONI webpage</a>.</p>

          <p><h1>The quick trip report</h1>

<p>I spent the past week in Sweden for the Stockholm Internet Forum<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, to meet up with our funders at Sida<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, and to meet some activists looking for help and advice for their cause back in their home countries. Overall, it was a great trip. The Biståndsminister (Minister for Development)<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, Gunilla Carlsson, specifically named Tor in her speech as a project she is proud to support and fund.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I gave a Tor talk to support DFRI <sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>. The room was in a different building, way in back, with few signs to direct you to it. Hanna from dfri went out to grab people. In a short while, the room was packed, with people standing in the back and people sitting in the window seats. I would say roughly 35 people came and left during the session. I purposely did a quick 30 minute tor talk to leave time for questions. There were lots of questions, most about how to help and improve tor. The TeliaSonera<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> people were interested in the intersection of Tor and the EU Data Retention Directive being implemented in Sweden on May 1. I&#39;m not sure if TeliaSonera is for or against data retention. Frank La Rue<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, was in the room for most of the talk too.</p>

<h1>Misconceptions around Tor</h1>

<p>Many Europeans thought we were a Swedish company already and were generally surprised to hear we are from the States. The Latin Americans and Middle East people are cautiously supportive of Tor. I kept running into misconceptions about Tor, the charity, the software, and if we&#39;re humans or not. Hopefully this post will clear up these misconceptions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tor was not started by the US Navy. The US Naval Research Labs (NRL) started a project in the 1990s called onion routing<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>. Tor uses the basic onion routing principles and applies them to the Internet. The volunteer Tor group started in 2001. The formal charity, The Tor Project, started in 2006. We continue to work with Dr. Paul Syverson from NRL on improving onion routing and therefore Tor.</li>
<li>The goal of Tor is to give you control over your identity and privacy on the Internet. An equal goal is to enable research into anonymous communications on the Internet. We try very hard to make you anonymous by default. With this anonymity, it is up to you where you go, what you do, and what information about yourself you divulge. The goal is that you are in control.</li>
<li>In 2011, Tor received a total of $1.3 million in funding from a few sources: Internews, The Broadcasting Board of Governers, Sida, SRI International, and roughly 700 individual donors. Our forthcoming audit will show the funding and how we spent it. People seem to think Tor is a massive operation with hundreds of millions in funding. We publish our audit reports and financial statements every year after our audit is complete<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Tor has a paid staff of 13 people. 10 of the 13 are developers and researchers. We have a part-time CFO, a marketing/policy person, and an Executive Director. We rely heavily on thousands of volunteers. We care a great deal about our community. Our core people<sup><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> are the most dedicated to improving Tor and have contributed greatly to the cause. We are currently looking to make this 14 people by hiring a dedicated developer<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>.</li>
<li>We are human. Each of us involved is generally public about who we are and what we do for Tor. As we&#39;re only 13 people, we cannot be everywhere at once. We spend very, very little on marketing and advertising. A few of us, namely Roger, Jacob, Andrew, and Karen, do the bulk of public speaking. You can see various videos of our talks, lectures, and speeches in our media archive<sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the trip to Sweden was successful. And I hope these five points clarify who and what is Tor.</p>
