	      <p><strong>Tor 0.2.2.35 fixes a critical heap-overflow security issue in Tor&#39;s
 buffers code. Absolutely everybody should upgrade.</strong></p>

<p>The bug relied on an incorrect calculation when making data continuous
 in one of our IO buffers, if the first chunk of the buffer was
 misaligned by just the wrong amount. The miscalculation would allow an
 attacker to overflow a piece of heap-allocated memory. To mount this
 attack, the attacker would need to either open a SOCKS connection to
 Tor&#39;s SocksPort (usually restricted to localhost), or target a Tor
 instance configured to make its connections through a SOCKS proxy
 (which Tor does not do by default).</p>

<p>Good security practice requires that all heap-overflow bugs should be
 presumed to be exploitable until proven otherwise, so we are treating
 this as a potential code execution attack. Please upgrade immediately!
 This bug does not affect bufferevents-based builds of Tor. Special
 thanks to &quot;Vektor&quot; for reporting this issue to us!</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.35 also fixes several bugs in previous versions, including
 crash bugs for unusual configurations, and a long-term bug that
 would prevent Tor from starting on Windows machines with draconian
 AV software.</p>

<p>With this release, we remind everyone that 0.2.0.x has reached its
 formal end-of-life. Those Tor versions have many known flaws, and
 nobody should be using them. You should upgrade -- ideally to the
 0.2.2.x series. If you&#39;re using a Linux or BSD and its packages are
 obsolete, stop using those packages and upgrade anyway.</p>

<p>The Tor 0.2.1.x series is also approaching its end-of-life: it will no
 longer receive support after some time in early 2012.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.35 - 2011-12-16</strong></p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a heap overflow bug that could occur when trying to pull
data into the first chunk of a buffer, when that chunk had
already had some data drained from it. Fixes CVE-2011-2778;
bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by &quot;Vektor&quot;.</li>
<li>Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so
that it doesn&#39;t attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause
some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for
bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through
2.0.15-stable.</li>
<li>If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,
don&#39;t process any further cells on it. We already avoid further
reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the
cells we&#39;d already read. Fixes bug 4299; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha,
which was the first version where we might mark a connection for
close based on processing a cell on it.</li>
<li>Correctly sanity-check that we don&#39;t underflow on a memory
allocation (and then assert) for hidden service introduction
point decryption. Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;
bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak when we check whether a hidden service
descriptor has any usable introduction points left. Fixes bug

<ol>
<li>Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Don&#39;t crash when we&#39;re running as a relay and don&#39;t have a GeoIP
file. Bugfix on 0.2.2.34; fixes bug 4340. This backports a fix
we&#39;ve had in the 0.2.3.x branch already.</li>
<li>When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain
wrong) log message that we&#39;re collecting &quot;directory request&quot;
statistics: clients don&#39;t collect statistics. Also don&#39;t create a
useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory. Fixes
bug 4353; bugfix on 0.2.2.34.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Detect failure to initialize Libevent. This fix provides better
detection for future instances of bug 4457.</li>
<li>Avoid frequent calls to the fairly expensive cull_wedged_cpuworkers
function. This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some
busy servers. Fixes bug 4518; bugfix on 0.0.9.8.</li>
<li>Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist_ensure_capacity().
Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by
Mansour Moufid.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn about unused log_mutex in log.c when building with
--disable-threads using a recent GCC. Fixes bug 4437; bugfix on
0.1.0.6-rc which introduced --disable-threads.</li>
<li>When configuring, starting, or stopping an NT service, stop
immediately after the service configuration attempt has succeeded
or failed. Fixes bug 3963; bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.</li>
<li>When sending a NETINFO cell, include the original address
received for the other side, not its canonical address. Found
by &quot;troll_un&quot;; fixes bug 4349; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix a typo in a hibernation-related log message. Fixes bug 4331;
bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by &quot;tmpname0901&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak in launch_direct_bridge_descriptor_fetch() that
occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge
in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
<li>Backport fixes for a pair of compilation warnings on Windows.
Fixes bug 4521; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta and on 0.2.2.29-beta.</li>
<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str on an address of
unknown type, we would have done a strdup on an uninitialized
buffer. Now we won&#39;t. Fixes bug 4529; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Correctly detect and handle transient lookup failures from
tor_addr_lookup. Fixes bug 4530; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.
Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Use tor_socket_t type for listener argument to accept(). Fixes bug
4535; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add two new config options for directory authorities:
AuthDirFastGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold for guaranteeing the
Fast flag, and AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold
that is always sufficient to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for
the Guard flag. Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate
Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.</li>
<li>When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,
include the hidden service&#39;s directory in the warning message.
Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service
was ignored. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes bug 4426.</li>
<li>Update to the December 6 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make it easier to automate expert package builds on Windows,
by removing an absolute path from makensis.exe command.</li>

	      <p>Tor 0.2.3.9-alpha introduces initial IPv6 support for bridges, adds
 a &quot;DisableNetwork&quot; security feature that bundles can use to avoid
 touching the network until bridges are configured, moves forward on
 the pluggable transport design, fixes a flaw in the hidden service
 design that unnecessarily prevented clients with wrong clocks from
 reaching hidden services, and fixes a wide variety of other issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.3.9-alpha - 2011-12-08</strong>
<strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clients can now connect to private bridges over IPv6. Bridges
still need at least one IPv4 address in order to connect to
other relays. Note that we don&#39;t yet handle the case where the
user has two bridge lines for the same bridge (one IPv4, one
IPv6). Implements parts of proposal 186.</li>
<li>New &quot;DisableNetwork&quot; config option to prevent Tor from launching any
connections or accepting any connections except on a control port.
Bundles and controllers can set this option before letting Tor talk
to the rest of the network, for example to prevent any connections
to a non-bridge address. Packages like Orbot can also use this
option to instruct Tor to save power when the network is off.</li>
<li>Clients and bridges can now be configured to use a separate
&quot;transport&quot; proxy. This approach makes the censorship arms race
easier by allowing bridges to use protocol obfuscation plugins. It
implements the &quot;managed proxy&quot; part of proposal 180 (ticket 3472).</li>
<li>When using OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later, use OpenSSL&#39;s counter mode
implementation. It makes AES_CTR about 7% faster than our old one
(which was about 10% faster than the one OpenSSL used to provide).
Resolves ticket 4526.</li>
<li>Add a &quot;tor2web mode&quot; for clients that want to connect to hidden
services non-anonymously (and possibly more quickly). As a safety
measure to try to keep users from turning this on without knowing
what they are doing, tor2web mode must be explicitly enabled at
compile time, and a copy of Tor compiled to run in tor2web mode
cannot be used as a normal Tor client. Implements feature 2553.</li>
<li>Add experimental support for running on Windows with IOCP and no
kernel-space socket buffers. This feature is controlled by a new
&quot;UserspaceIOCPBuffers&quot; config option (off by default), which has
no effect unless Tor has been built with support for bufferevents,
is running on Windows, and has enabled IOCP. This may, in the long
run, help solve or mitigate bug 98.</li>
<li>Use a more secure consensus parameter voting algorithm. Now at
least three directory authorities or a majority of them must
vote on a given parameter before it will be included in the
consensus. Implements proposal 178.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden services now ignore the timestamps on INTRODUCE2 cells.
They used to check that the timestamp was within 30 minutes
of their system clock, so they could cap the size of their
replay-detection cache, but that approach unnecessarily refused
service to clients with wrong clocks. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha, when
the v3 intro-point protocol (the first one which sent a timestamp
field in the INTRODUCE2 cell) was introduced; fixes bug 3460.</li>
<li>Only use the EVP interface when AES acceleration is enabled,
to avoid a 5-7% performance regression. Resolves issue 4525;
bugfix on 0.2.3.8-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy/anonymity features (bridge detection):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make bridge SSL certificates a bit more stealthy by using random
serial numbers, in the same fashion as OpenSSL when generating
self-signed certificates. Implements ticket 4584.</li>
<li>Introduce a new config option &quot;DynamicDHGroups&quot;, enabled by
default, which provides each bridge with a unique prime DH modulus
to be used during SSL handshakes. This option attempts to help
against censors who might use the Apache DH modulus as a static
identifier for bridges. Addresses ticket 4548.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features (new/different config options):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New configuration option &quot;DisableDebuggerAttachment&quot; (on by default)
to prevent basic debugging attachment attempts by other processes.
Supports Mac OS X and Gnu/Linux. Resolves ticket 3313.</li>
<li>Allow MapAddress directives to specify matches against super-domains,
as in &quot;MapAddress *.torproject.org *.torproject.org.torserver.exit&quot;.
Implements issue 933.</li>
<li>Slightly change behavior of &quot;list&quot; options (that is, config
options that can appear more than once) when they appear both in
torrc and on the command line. Previously, the command-line options
would be appended to the ones from torrc. Now, the command-line
options override the torrc options entirely. This new behavior
allows the user to override list options (like exit policies and
ports to listen on) from the command line, rather than simply
appending to the list.</li>
<li>You can get the old (appending) command-line behavior for &quot;list&quot;
options by prefixing the option name with a &quot;+&quot;.</li>
<li>You can remove all the values for a &quot;list&quot; option from the command
line without adding any new ones by prefixing the option name
with a &quot;/&quot;.</li>
<li>Add experimental support for a &quot;defaults&quot; torrc file to be parsed
before the regular torrc. Torrc options override the defaults file&#39;s
options in the same way that the command line overrides the torrc.
The SAVECONF controller command saves only those options which
differ between the current configuration and the defaults file. HUP
reloads both files. (Note: This is an experimental feature; its
behavior will probably be refined in future 0.2.3.x-alpha versions
to better meet packagers&#39; needs.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try to make the introductory warning message that Tor prints on
startup more useful for actually finding help and information.
Resolves ticket 2474.</li>
<li>Running &quot;make version&quot; now displays the version of Tor that
we&#39;re about to build. Idea from katmagic; resolves issue 4400.</li>
<li>Expire old or over-used hidden service introduction points.
Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>
<li>Move the replay-detection cache for the RSA-encrypted parts of
INTRODUCE2 cells to the introduction point data structures.
Previously, we would use one replay-detection cache per hidden
service. Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>
<li>Reduce the lifetime of elements of hidden services&#39; Diffie-Hellman
public key replay-detection cache from 60 minutes to 5 minutes. This
replay-detection cache is now used only to detect multiple
INTRODUCE2 cells specifying the same rendezvous point, so we can
avoid launching multiple simultaneous attempts to connect to it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x and earlier):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist_ensure_capacity().
Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by
Mansour Moufid.</li>
<li>Fix a minor formatting issue in one of tor-gencert&#39;s error messages.
Fixes bug 4574.</li>
<li>Prevent a false positive from the check-spaces script, by disabling
the &quot;whitespace between function name and (&quot; check for functions
named &#39;op()&#39;.</li>
<li>Fix a log message suggesting that people contact a non-existent
email address. Fixes bug 3448.</li>
<li>Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.
Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Report a real bootstrap problem to the controller on router
identity mismatch. Previously we just said &quot;foo&quot;, which probably
made a lot of sense at the time. Fixes bug 4169; bugfix on
0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str() on an address of
unknown type, we would have done a strdup() on an uninitialized

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Once we get <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses">more (and more diverse) bridge addresses</a>, the next research step is that we&#39;ll need to get better at telling which bridges are blocked in which jurisdictions. For example, most of the bridges we give out via https and gmail are blocked in China. But which ones exactly? How quickly do they get blocked? Do some last longer than others? Do they ever get unblocked? Is there some pattern to the blocking, either by time, by IP address or network, by user load on the bridge, or by distribution strategy? We can&#39;t evaluate <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies">new bridge distribution strategies</a> if we can&#39;t track whether the bridges in each strategy are being blocked.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, bridge reachability tests break down into two approaches: passive and active. Passive tests don&#39;t involve any new connections on the part of Tor clients or bridges, whereas active tests follow the more traditional &quot;scanning&quot; idea. None of the reachability tests we&#39;ve thought of are perfect. Instead, here we discuss how to combine imperfect tests and use feedback from the tests to balance their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approaches</strong></p>

<p>We should explore two types of passive testing approaches: reporting from bridges and reporting from clients.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approach 1: reporting from bridges.</strong> Right now Tor relays and bridges publish <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf">aggregate user counts</a> — rough number of users per country per day. In theory we can look at the user counts over time to detect statistical drops in usage for a given country. That approach has produced useful results in practice for overall connections to the public Tor relays from each country: see George Danezis&#39;s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/detector-2011-09-09.pdf">initial work</a> on a Tor censorship detector.</p>

<p>But there are two stumbling blocks when trying to apply the censorship detector model to individual bridges. First, we don&#39;t have ground truth about which bridges were <em>actually</em> blocked or not at a given time, so we have no way to validate our models. Second, while overall usage of bridges in a given country might be high, the load <em>on a given bridge</em> tends to be quite low, which in turns makes it <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/blocking-2011-09-15.pdf">difficult to achieve statistical significance</a> when looking at usage drops.</p>

<p>Ground truth needs to be learned through active tests: we train the models with usage patterns for bridges that get blocked and bridges that don&#39;t get blocked, and the model predictions should improve. The question of statistical significance can be overcome by treating the prediction as a hint: even if our models don&#39;t give us enough confidence to answer &quot;blocked for sure&quot; or &quot;not blocked for sure&quot; about a given bridge, they should be able to give us a number reflecting likelihood that the bridge is now blocked. That number should feed back into the active tests, for example so we pay more attention to bridges that are more likely to be newly blocked.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approach 2: reporting from clients.</strong> In addition to the usage reporting by bridges, we should also consider reachability reporting by clients. Imagine a Tor client that has ten bridges configured. It tries to connect to each of them, and finds that two work and eight don&#39;t. This client is doing our scanning for us, if only we could safely learn about its results. The first issue that comes up is that it could mistakenly report that a bridge is blocked if that bridge is instead simply down. So we would want to compare the reports to concurrent active scans from a &quot;more free&quot; jurisdiction, to pick out the bridges that are up in one place yet down in another.</p>

<p>From there, the questions get trickier: 1) does the set of bridges that a given user reports about create a fingerprint that lets us recognize that user later? Even if the user reports about each bridge through a separate Tor circuit, we&#39;d like to know the time of the scan, and nearby times can be used to build a statistical profile. 2) What if users submit intentionally misleading reports? It seems there&#39;s a tension between wanting to build a profile for the user (to increase our confidence in the validity of her reports) versus wanting to make sure the user doesn&#39;t develop any recognizable profile. Perhaps the <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing">Nymble</a> design family can contribute an &quot;unlinkable reputation&quot; trick to resolve the conflict, but as we find ourselves saying so often at Tor, more research remains.</p>

<p><strong>Active approaches</strong></p>

<p>The goal of active scanning is to get ground truth on whether each bridge is really blocked. There&#39;s a tradeoff here: frequent scans give us better resolution and increased confidence, but too many scan attempts draw attention to the scanners and thus to the addresses being scanned.</p>

<p>We should use the results of the passive and indirect scans to give hints about what addresses to do active scans on. In the steady-state, we should aim to limit our active scans to bridges that we think just went from unblocked to blocked or vice versa, and to a sample of others for spot checks to keep our models trained.</p>

<p>There are three pieces to active scanning: direct scans, reverse scans, and indirect scans.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 1: direct scans.</strong> Direct scans are what we traditionally think of when we think of scanning: get access to a computer in the target country, give it a list of bridges, and have it connect directly to each bridge on the list.</p>

<p>Before I continue though, I should take an aside to discuss types of blocking. In September 2009 when China first blocked some bridges, I spent a while probing the blocked bridges from a computer in Beijing. From what I could tell, China blocked the bridges in two ways. If the bridge had no other interesting services running (like a webserver), they just blackholed the IP address, meaning no packets to or from the IP address made it through the firewall. But if there <em>was</em> an interesting service, they blocked the bridge by IP and port. (I could imagine this more fine-grained blocking was done by dropping SYN packets, or by sending TCP RST packets; but I didn&#39;t get that far in my investigation.)</p>

<p>So there are two lessons to be learned here. First, the degree to which our active scans match real Tor client behavior could influence the accuracy of the scans. Second, some real-world adversaries are putting considerable effort — probably manual effort — into examining the bridges they find and choosing how best to filter them. After all, if they just blindly filtered IP addresses we list as bridges, we could add Baidu&#39;s address as a bridge and make them look foolish. (We tried that; it didn&#39;t work.)</p>

<p>These lessons leave us with two design choices to consider.</p>

<p>First, how much of the Tor protocol should we use when doing the scans? The spectrum ranges from a simple TCP scan (or even just a SYN scan), to a vanilla SSL handshake, to driving a real Tor client that does a genuine Tor handshake. The less realistic the handshake, the more risk that we conclude the bridge is reachable when in fact it isn&#39;t; but the more realistic the handshake, the more we stand out to an adversary watching for Tor-like traffic.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the adversary is <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges">discovering bridges</a> also impacts which reachability tests are a smart idea. For example, it appears that China may have recently started doing deep packet inspection (DPI) for Tor-like connections over the Great Firewall and then doing active-followup SSL handshakes to confirm which addresses are Tor bridges. If that report turns out to be true, testing bridge reachability via active scans that include handshaking would be counterproductive: the act of doing the test would influence the answer. We can solve their attack by <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix">changing our handshake</a> so they don&#39;t recognize it anymore, or by introducing <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc9.3">scanning-resistance</a> measures like bridge passwords. In the shorter-term, we should confirm that simple connection scanning (without a handshake) doesn&#39;t trigger any blocks, and then restrict ourselves to that type of scanning in China until we&#39;ve deployed a better answer.</p>

<p>Second, should we scan &quot;decoy&quot; addresses as well, to fool an observer into thinking that we&#39;re not scanning for Tor bridges in particular, and/or to drive up the work the observer needs to do to distinguish the &quot;real&quot; bridges? Whether this trick is useful depends on the level of sophistication and dedication of the adversary. For example, China has already demonstrated that they check IP addresses before blocking them, and in general I worry that the more connections you make to <em>anything</em>, the more likely you are to attract attention for further scrutiny. How would we generate the list of decoy addresses? If we choose it randomly from the space of IP addresses, a) most of them will not respond, and b) we&#39;ll invite abuse complaints from security people looking for worms. Driving up the work factor sounds like a great feature, but it could have the side effect that it encourages the adversary to invest in an automated &quot;is this a Tor bridge&quot; checker, which would be an unfortunate step for them to take if they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Active direct scans come with a fundamental dilemma: the more we think a bridge has been blocked, the more we want to scan it; but the more likely it is to be blocked, the more the adversary might already be watching for connections to it, for example to do a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges">&quot;zig-zag&quot; bridge enumeration attack</a>. So we need to avoid scanning bridges that we think are not blocked. But we also need to explore more subtle scanning techniques such as the ones below.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 2: reverse scans.</strong> A bridge that gets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_%28telecommunications%29">duplex</a> blackholed by a government firewall can learn that it has been filtered by trying to make a connection <em>into</em> the filtered country.</p>

<p>For example, each bridge might automatically connect to baidu.com periodically, and publish the results of its reachability test in its extrainfo descriptor. We could either feed this information into the models and follow up with other active probes if the bridge thinks it&#39;s been blocked; or we could use it the other way by instructing bridges that we think have been blocked to launch a reverse scan.</p>

<p>We can actually take advantage of the flexibility of the Tor protocol to do scanning from each bridge to Baidu without changing the bridge code at all: we simply try to extend an ordinary circuit from the bridge to the target destination, and learn at what stage the &#39;extend&#39; request failed. (We should <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2576">extend the Tor control protocol</a> to expose the type of failure to the Tor controller, but that&#39;s a simple matter of programming.)</p>

<p>Note that these reverse scans can tell us that a bridge has been blocked, but it can&#39;t tell us that a bridge <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been blocked, since it could just be blocked in a more fine-grained way.</p>

<p>Finally, how noticeable would these reverse scans be? That is, could the government firewall enumerate bridges by keeping an eye out for Tor-like connection attempts to Baidu? While teaching the bridges to do the scanning themselves would require more work, it would give us more control over how much the scans stick out.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 3: indirect scans.</strong> Indirect scans use other services as reflectors. For example, you can connect to an FTP server inside the target country, tell it that your address is the address of the bridge you want to scan, and then try to fetch a file. How it fails should tell you whether that FTP server could reach the bridge or not.</p>

<p>There are many other potential reflector protocols out there, each with their own tradeoffs. For example, can we instruct a DNS request in-country to recurse to the target bridge address, and distinguish between &quot;I couldn&#39;t reach that DNS server&quot; and &quot;that wasn&#39;t a DNS server&quot;? (DNS is probably not the right protocol to use inside China, given the amount of DNS mucking they are already known to do.)</p>

<p>Another avenue is a variant on <a href="http://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html">idle scanning</a>, which takes advantage of predictable TCP IPID patterns: send a packet directly to the bridge to learn its current IPID, then instruct some computer in-country to send a packet, and then send another packet directly to find the new IPID and learn whether or not the in-country packet arrived.</p>

<p>What other services can be bent to our will? Can we advertise the bridge address on a bittorrent tracker that&#39;s popular in China and see whether anybody connects? Much creative research remains here.</p>

<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p>

<p>One of the puzzle pieces holding us back from rolling out the &quot;tens of thousands of bridge addresses offered by volunteers with spare net blocks&quot; plan is that we need better ways to get feedback on when addresses get blocked. The ideas in this blog post hopefully provide a good framework for thinking about the problem.</p>

<p>For the short term, we should deploy a basic TCP connection scanner from inside several censoring countries (China, Iran, and Syria come to mind). Since the &quot;clients report&quot; passive strategy still has some open research questions, we should get all our hints from the &quot;bridges report&quot; passive strategy. As we&#39;re ramping up, and especially since our current bridges are either not blocked at all (outside China), or mostly blocked (inside China), we should feel free to do more thorough active scans to get a better intuition about what scanning can teach us.</p>

<p>In the long term, I want to use these various building blocks in a feedback loop to identify and reward successful bridge distribution strategies, as outlined in Levchenko and McCoy&#39;s <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#proximax11">FC 2011 paper</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, we need these four building blocks:</p>

<p>1) A way to discover how much use a bridge is seeing from a given country. Done: see the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf">WECSR10 paper</a> and <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#bridge-users">usage graphs</a>.</p>

<p>2) A way to get fresh bridge addresses over time. The more addresses we can churn through, the more aggressive we can be in experimenting with novel distribution approaches. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses">the &quot;more bridge addresses&quot; blog post</a> for directions here.</p>

<p>3) A way to discover when a bridge is blocked in a given country. That&#39;s what this blog post is about.</p>

<p>4) Distribution strategies that rely on different mechanisms to make enumeration difficult. Beyond our &quot;https&quot; and &quot;gmail&quot; distribution strategies, we know a variety of people in censored countries, and we can think of each of these people as a distribution channel.</p>

<p>We can define the <em>efficiency</em> of a bridge address in terms of how many people use it and how long before it gets blocked. So a bridge that gets blocked very quickly scores a low efficiency, a bridge that doesn&#39;t get blocked but doesn&#39;t see much use scores a medium efficiency, and a popular bridge that doesn&#39;t get blocked scores high. We can characterize the efficiency of a distribution channel as a function of the efficiency of the bridges it distributes. The key insight is that we then adapt how many new bridges we give to each distribution channel based on its efficiency. So channels that are working well automatically get more addresses to give out, and channels that aren&#39;t working well automatically end up with fewer addresses.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s more to it than that. For example, we need to consider how to handle the presence of bridge enumeration attacks that work independently of which distribution channel a given bridge address was given to. We also need to consider attacks that artificially inflate the efficiency of bridges (and thus make us overreward distribution channels), or that learn about a bridge but choose not to block it. But that, as they say, is a story for another time.</p>
