	      <p>Once we get <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses">more (and more diverse) bridge addresses</a>, the next research step is that we&#39;ll need to get better at telling which bridges are blocked in which jurisdictions. For example, most of the bridges we give out via https and gmail are blocked in China. But which ones exactly? How quickly do they get blocked? Do some last longer than others? Do they ever get unblocked? Is there some pattern to the blocking, either by time, by IP address or network, by user load on the bridge, or by distribution strategy? We can&#39;t evaluate <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies">new bridge distribution strategies</a> if we can&#39;t track whether the bridges in each strategy are being blocked.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, bridge reachability tests break down into two approaches: passive and active. Passive tests don&#39;t involve any new connections on the part of Tor clients or bridges, whereas active tests follow the more traditional &quot;scanning&quot; idea. None of the reachability tests we&#39;ve thought of are perfect. Instead, here we discuss how to combine imperfect tests and use feedback from the tests to balance their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approaches</strong></p>

<p>We should explore two types of passive testing approaches: reporting from bridges and reporting from clients.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approach 1: reporting from bridges.</strong> Right now Tor relays and bridges publish <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf">aggregate user counts</a> — rough number of users per country per day. In theory we can look at the user counts over time to detect statistical drops in usage for a given country. That approach has produced useful results in practice for overall connections to the public Tor relays from each country: see George Danezis&#39;s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/detector-2011-09-09.pdf">initial work</a> on a Tor censorship detector.</p>

<p>But there are two stumbling blocks when trying to apply the censorship detector model to individual bridges. First, we don&#39;t have ground truth about which bridges were <em>actually</em> blocked or not at a given time, so we have no way to validate our models. Second, while overall usage of bridges in a given country might be high, the load <em>on a given bridge</em> tends to be quite low, which in turns makes it <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/blocking-2011-09-15.pdf">difficult to achieve statistical significance</a> when looking at usage drops.</p>

<p>Ground truth needs to be learned through active tests: we train the models with usage patterns for bridges that get blocked and bridges that don&#39;t get blocked, and the model predictions should improve. The question of statistical significance can be overcome by treating the prediction as a hint: even if our models don&#39;t give us enough confidence to answer &quot;blocked for sure&quot; or &quot;not blocked for sure&quot; about a given bridge, they should be able to give us a number reflecting likelihood that the bridge is now blocked. That number should feed back into the active tests, for example so we pay more attention to bridges that are more likely to be newly blocked.</p>

<p><strong>Passive approach 2: reporting from clients.</strong> In addition to the usage reporting by bridges, we should also consider reachability reporting by clients. Imagine a Tor client that has ten bridges configured. It tries to connect to each of them, and finds that two work and eight don&#39;t. This client is doing our scanning for us, if only we could safely learn about its results. The first issue that comes up is that it could mistakenly report that a bridge is blocked if that bridge is instead simply down. So we would want to compare the reports to concurrent active scans from a &quot;more free&quot; jurisdiction, to pick out the bridges that are up in one place yet down in another.</p>

<p>From there, the questions get trickier: 1) does the set of bridges that a given user reports about create a fingerprint that lets us recognize that user later? Even if the user reports about each bridge through a separate Tor circuit, we&#39;d like to know the time of the scan, and nearby times can be used to build a statistical profile. 2) What if users submit intentionally misleading reports? It seems there&#39;s a tension between wanting to build a profile for the user (to increase our confidence in the validity of her reports) versus wanting to make sure the user doesn&#39;t develop any recognizable profile. Perhaps the <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing">Nymble</a> design family can contribute an &quot;unlinkable reputation&quot; trick to resolve the conflict, but as we find ourselves saying so often at Tor, more research remains.</p>

<p><strong>Active approaches</strong></p>

<p>The goal of active scanning is to get ground truth on whether each bridge is really blocked. There&#39;s a tradeoff here: frequent scans give us better resolution and increased confidence, but too many scan attempts draw attention to the scanners and thus to the addresses being scanned.</p>

<p>We should use the results of the passive and indirect scans to give hints about what addresses to do active scans on. In the steady-state, we should aim to limit our active scans to bridges that we think just went from unblocked to blocked or vice versa, and to a sample of others for spot checks to keep our models trained.</p>

<p>There are three pieces to active scanning: direct scans, reverse scans, and indirect scans.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 1: direct scans.</strong> Direct scans are what we traditionally think of when we think of scanning: get access to a computer in the target country, give it a list of bridges, and have it connect directly to each bridge on the list.</p>

<p>Before I continue though, I should take an aside to discuss types of blocking. In September 2009 when China first blocked some bridges, I spent a while probing the blocked bridges from a computer in Beijing. From what I could tell, China blocked the bridges in two ways. If the bridge had no other interesting services running (like a webserver), they just blackholed the IP address, meaning no packets to or from the IP address made it through the firewall. But if there <em>was</em> an interesting service, they blocked the bridge by IP and port. (I could imagine this more fine-grained blocking was done by dropping SYN packets, or by sending TCP RST packets; but I didn&#39;t get that far in my investigation.)</p>

<p>So there are two lessons to be learned here. First, the degree to which our active scans match real Tor client behavior could influence the accuracy of the scans. Second, some real-world adversaries are putting considerable effort — probably manual effort — into examining the bridges they find and choosing how best to filter them. After all, if they just blindly filtered IP addresses we list as bridges, we could add Baidu&#39;s address as a bridge and make them look foolish. (We tried that; it didn&#39;t work.)</p>

<p>These lessons leave us with two design choices to consider.</p>

<p>First, how much of the Tor protocol should we use when doing the scans? The spectrum ranges from a simple TCP scan (or even just a SYN scan), to a vanilla SSL handshake, to driving a real Tor client that does a genuine Tor handshake. The less realistic the handshake, the more risk that we conclude the bridge is reachable when in fact it isn&#39;t; but the more realistic the handshake, the more we stand out to an adversary watching for Tor-like traffic.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the adversary is <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges">discovering bridges</a> also impacts which reachability tests are a smart idea. For example, it appears that China may have recently started doing deep packet inspection (DPI) for Tor-like connections over the Great Firewall and then doing active-followup SSL handshakes to confirm which addresses are Tor bridges. If that report turns out to be true, testing bridge reachability via active scans that include handshaking would be counterproductive: the act of doing the test would influence the answer. We can solve their attack by <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix">changing our handshake</a> so they don&#39;t recognize it anymore, or by introducing <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc9.3">scanning-resistance</a> measures like bridge passwords. In the shorter-term, we should confirm that simple connection scanning (without a handshake) doesn&#39;t trigger any blocks, and then restrict ourselves to that type of scanning in China until we&#39;ve deployed a better answer.</p>

<p>Second, should we scan &quot;decoy&quot; addresses as well, to fool an observer into thinking that we&#39;re not scanning for Tor bridges in particular, and/or to drive up the work the observer needs to do to distinguish the &quot;real&quot; bridges? Whether this trick is useful depends on the level of sophistication and dedication of the adversary. For example, China has already demonstrated that they check IP addresses before blocking them, and in general I worry that the more connections you make to <em>anything</em>, the more likely you are to attract attention for further scrutiny. How would we generate the list of decoy addresses? If we choose it randomly from the space of IP addresses, a) most of them will not respond, and b) we&#39;ll invite abuse complaints from security people looking for worms. Driving up the work factor sounds like a great feature, but it could have the side effect that it encourages the adversary to invest in an automated &quot;is this a Tor bridge&quot; checker, which would be an unfortunate step for them to take if they otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Active direct scans come with a fundamental dilemma: the more we think a bridge has been blocked, the more we want to scan it; but the more likely it is to be blocked, the more the adversary might already be watching for connections to it, for example to do a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges">&quot;zig-zag&quot; bridge enumeration attack</a>. So we need to avoid scanning bridges that we think are not blocked. But we also need to explore more subtle scanning techniques such as the ones below.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 2: reverse scans.</strong> A bridge that gets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_%28telecommunications%29">duplex</a> blackholed by a government firewall can learn that it has been filtered by trying to make a connection <em>into</em> the filtered country.</p>

<p>For example, each bridge might automatically connect to baidu.com periodically, and publish the results of its reachability test in its extrainfo descriptor. We could either feed this information into the models and follow up with other active probes if the bridge thinks it&#39;s been blocked; or we could use it the other way by instructing bridges that we think have been blocked to launch a reverse scan.</p>

<p>We can actually take advantage of the flexibility of the Tor protocol to do scanning from each bridge to Baidu without changing the bridge code at all: we simply try to extend an ordinary circuit from the bridge to the target destination, and learn at what stage the &#39;extend&#39; request failed. (We should <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2576">extend the Tor control protocol</a> to expose the type of failure to the Tor controller, but that&#39;s a simple matter of programming.)</p>

<p>Note that these reverse scans can tell us that a bridge has been blocked, but it can&#39;t tell us that a bridge <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been blocked, since it could just be blocked in a more fine-grained way.</p>

<p>Finally, how noticeable would these reverse scans be? That is, could the government firewall enumerate bridges by keeping an eye out for Tor-like connection attempts to Baidu? While teaching the bridges to do the scanning themselves would require more work, it would give us more control over how much the scans stick out.</p>

<p><strong>Active approach 3: indirect scans.</strong> Indirect scans use other services as reflectors. For example, you can connect to an FTP server inside the target country, tell it that your address is the address of the bridge you want to scan, and then try to fetch a file. How it fails should tell you whether that FTP server could reach the bridge or not.</p>

<p>There are many other potential reflector protocols out there, each with their own tradeoffs. For example, can we instruct a DNS request in-country to recurse to the target bridge address, and distinguish between &quot;I couldn&#39;t reach that DNS server&quot; and &quot;that wasn&#39;t a DNS server&quot;? (DNS is probably not the right protocol to use inside China, given the amount of DNS mucking they are already known to do.)</p>

<p>Another avenue is a variant on <a href="http://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html">idle scanning</a>, which takes advantage of predictable TCP IPID patterns: send a packet directly to the bridge to learn its current IPID, then instruct some computer in-country to send a packet, and then send another packet directly to find the new IPID and learn whether or not the in-country packet arrived.</p>

<p>What other services can be bent to our will? Can we advertise the bridge address on a bittorrent tracker that&#39;s popular in China and see whether anybody connects? Much creative research remains here.</p>

<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p>

<p>One of the puzzle pieces holding us back from rolling out the &quot;tens of thousands of bridge addresses offered by volunteers with spare net blocks&quot; plan is that we need better ways to get feedback on when addresses get blocked. The ideas in this blog post hopefully provide a good framework for thinking about the problem.</p>

<p>For the short term, we should deploy a basic TCP connection scanner from inside several censoring countries (China, Iran, and Syria come to mind). Since the &quot;clients report&quot; passive strategy still has some open research questions, we should get all our hints from the &quot;bridges report&quot; passive strategy. As we&#39;re ramping up, and especially since our current bridges are either not blocked at all (outside China), or mostly blocked (inside China), we should feel free to do more thorough active scans to get a better intuition about what scanning can teach us.</p>

<p>In the long term, I want to use these various building blocks in a feedback loop to identify and reward successful bridge distribution strategies, as outlined in Levchenko and McCoy&#39;s <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#proximax11">FC 2011 paper</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, we need these four building blocks:</p>

<p>1) A way to discover how much use a bridge is seeing from a given country. Done: see the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf">WECSR10 paper</a> and <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#bridge-users">usage graphs</a>.</p>

<p>2) A way to get fresh bridge addresses over time. The more addresses we can churn through, the more aggressive we can be in experimenting with novel distribution approaches. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses">the &quot;more bridge addresses&quot; blog post</a> for directions here.</p>

<p>3) A way to discover when a bridge is blocked in a given country. That&#39;s what this blog post is about.</p>

<p>4) Distribution strategies that rely on different mechanisms to make enumeration difficult. Beyond our &quot;https&quot; and &quot;gmail&quot; distribution strategies, we know a variety of people in censored countries, and we can think of each of these people as a distribution channel.</p>

<p>We can define the <em>efficiency</em> of a bridge address in terms of how many people use it and how long before it gets blocked. So a bridge that gets blocked very quickly scores a low efficiency, a bridge that doesn&#39;t get blocked but doesn&#39;t see much use scores a medium efficiency, and a popular bridge that doesn&#39;t get blocked scores high. We can characterize the efficiency of a distribution channel as a function of the efficiency of the bridges it distributes. The key insight is that we then adapt how many new bridges we give to each distribution channel based on its efficiency. So channels that are working well automatically get more addresses to give out, and channels that aren&#39;t working well automatically end up with fewer addresses.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s more to it than that. For example, we need to consider how to handle the presence of bridge enumeration attacks that work independently of which distribution channel a given bridge address was given to. We also need to consider attacks that artificially inflate the efficiency of bridges (and thus make us overreward distribution channels), or that learn about a bridge but choose not to block it. But that, as they say, is a story for another time.</p>

	      <p><strong>Different Ways to Use a Bridge</strong></p>

<p>When some adversary prevents users from reaching the Tor network, our most popular answer is using bridge relays (or bridges for short). Those are hidden relays, not listed along with all the other relays in the networkstatus documents. Currently, we have about 600 of them, and censors are having different luck learning and blocking them — see <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges">the 10 ways to discover Tor bridges blog post</a> for more on how discovery approaches may work. China appears to be the only place able to successfully block most bridges consistently, whereas other places occasionally manage to block Tor&#39;s handshake and as a byproduct block all bridges too.</p>

<p>Bridge users can be broadly grouped in three camps:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Tor is blocked, and some way — any way — to reach the network has to be found. The adversary is not very dangerous, but very annoying.</li>
<li>  Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they&#39;re hiding Tor. The adversary may be extremely dangerous.</li>
<li>  Other bridge users: Testing whether the bridge works (automated or manual), probing, people using bridges without their knowledge because they came pre-configured in their bundle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we examine the first two use cases more closely. Specifically, we want to look at properties of a bridge that must exist for it to be useful to a user.</p>

<p><strong>Bridges — building blocks</strong></p>

<p>First off, it is helpful to understand some basics about bridges and how they are used by normal users.</p>

<p>Bridges are very similar to ordinary relays, in that they are operated by volunteers who made the decision to help people reach the Tor network. The difference to a normal relay is where the information about the bridge is published to — bridges can choose to either publish to the Bridge Authority (a special relay collecting all bridge addresses that it receives), or to not publish their information anywhere. The former are called public bridges, the latter private bridges.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have any information about the number of private bridges, but since the Bridge Authority collects data about the public bridges, we do know that bridges are used in the real world. See <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#bridge-users">the bridge users</a> and <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#networksize">networksize</a> graphs for some examples. Not having data about private bridges or their users means some of the analysis below is based on discussions with users of private bridges and our best estimates, and it can&#39;t be backed up by statistical data.</p>

<p>The reason we&#39;re using a Bridge Authority and collecting information about bridges is that we want to give out bridges to people who aren&#39;t in a position to learn about a private bridge themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;Learning about a bridge&quot; generally means learning about the bridge&#39;s IP address and port, so that a connection can be made. Optionally, the bridge identity fingerprint is included, too — this helps the client to verify that it is actually talking to the bridge, and not someone that is intercepting the network communication. For a private bridge, the operator has to pass on that information; public bridges wrap up some information about themselves in what is called their bridge descriptor and send that to the bridge authority. The bridge descriptor includes some statistical information, like aggregated user counts and countries of origin of traffic. Our analysis here focuses solely on the data provided by public bridges.</p>

<p>Once a user has learned about some bridges, she configures her Tor client to use them, typically by entering them into the appropriate field in Vidalia. Alternatively, she might use a different controller or put the data into tor&#39;s configuration file directly.</p>

<p><strong>Learning from bridge descriptor fetches</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve been collecting bridge descriptor fetch statistics on the bridge authority, and are using this data to pose some questions and propose some changes. The statistics collected are how many bridge descriptors were served in total, and how many unique descriptors were served, as well as the 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 percentiles of fetches per descriptor. Every 24 hours, the current statistics are written to disk and the counters reset. The current statistics are attached to this post, for closer inspection. We&#39;ve also prepared two graphs to easily see the data at a glance:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-total-downloads.png" alt="Total bridge downloads"></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-downloads-per-desc.png" alt="Bridge downloads per descriptor"></p>

<p>The first thing to note is that there aren&#39;t very many bridge descriptor fetches at all, which isn&#39;t a big surprise: The current Tor bundles don&#39;t fetch them when they&#39;re used in the typical way, that is by adding some bridges via Vidalia&#39;s interface after bridges were discovered via one of our bridge distribution channels. Over the past month, there have been between 3900 and 6600 fetches per day, with a median of 8 fetches per bridge. The most fetched descriptor is fetched up to 350 times per day, indicating that it does indeed belong to a bridge that was given out with a fingerprint and being used by Tor clients. We have gotten some reports that a bundle circulated with pre-configured bridges, and this could account for the many fetches.</p>

<p>Secondly, most bridge descriptors are not even fetched from the authority. This is a clear indication that we can improve our odds of updating bridge clients with current bridge info if we can get them to request the information better.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Tor&#39;s behaviour for the two user groups</strong></p>

<p>The first group (&quot;Tor is blocked, and some way to reach the network has to be found&quot;) is mostly concerned about circumvention, without necessarily hiding that they&#39;re using Tor from someone. Typically, access to the Internet is filtered, but circumventing a filter isn&#39;t too risky and people are more concerned with access than hiding their tracks from a data-collecting adversary. Speed, bootstrapping performance, and little intervention/maintenance of a setup are the biggest goals.</p>

<p>Adding auto-discovery mechanisms for bridges that changed their IP address will help this group gain a lot more robustness when it comes to maintaining connectivity against an adversary that blocks public relays, but isn&#39;t very quick in blocking all bridges. As far as we know, this is currently true for the majority of our bridge userbase.</p>

<p>For the second group (&quot;Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they&#39;re hiding Tor&quot;), precise control over Tor&#39;s actions is much more important than constant connectivity, and private bridges might be utilized to that end as well. A user in this group wants to keep the bridges he&#39;s using secret, and puts up with frequent updates to the configuration for the added safety of only connecting to a pre-specified IP address:port combination. We can&#39;t do very much for a user belonging to this group with regard to bridges, but he will very much benefit from improvements made to our general fingerprintability resistance. Also options like the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3644">DisableNetwork</a> option (prevent touching the network in any kind of way until this option is changed) that was recently introduced to Tor help him.</p>

<p>Another interesting point here is that we can indirectly improve the behaviour for the first group by not making it too easy to learn about bridges, because censors can use the same data to more effectively block them. This means that we shouldn&#39;t, for example, start giving out significantly more bridges to a single user.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve written a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2011-November/003097.html">proposal</a> to implement some changes in Tor, to better facilitate the needs of the first group of bridge users.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Tor 0.2.3.8-alpha fixes some crash and assert bugs, including a<br>
 socketpair-related bug that has been bothering Windows users. It adds<br>
 support to serve microdescriptors to controllers, so Vidalia&#39;s network<br>
 map can resume listing relays (once Vidalia implements its side),<br>
 and adds better support for hardware AES acceleration. Finally, it<br>
 starts the process of adjusting the bandwidth cutoff for getting the<br>
 &quot;Fast&quot; flag from 20KB to (currently) 32KB -- preliminary results show<br>
 that tiny relays harm performance more than they help network capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.3.8-alpha - 2011-11-22</strong><br>
 <strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so<br>
 that it doesn&#39;t attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause<br>
 some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for<br>
 bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through<br>
 2.0.15-stable.</li>
<li>  Correctly sanity-check that we don&#39;t underflow on a memory<br>
 allocation (and then assert) for hidden service introduction<br>
 point decryption. Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;<br>
 bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>
<li>  Remove the artificially low cutoff of 20KB to guarantee the Fast<br>
 flag. In the past few years the average relay speed has picked<br>
 up, and while the &quot;top 7/8 of the network get the Fast flag&quot; and<br>
 &quot;all relays with 20KB or more of capacity get the Fast flag&quot; rules<br>
 used to have the same result, now the top 7/8 of the network has<br>
 a capacity more like 32KB. Bugfix on 0.2.1.14-rc. Fixes bug 4489.</li>
<li>  Fix a rare assertion failure when checking whether a v0 hidden<br>
 service descriptor has any usable introduction points left, and<br>
 we don&#39;t have enough information to build a circuit to the first<br>
 intro point named in the descriptor. The HS client code in<br>
 0.2.3.x no longer uses v0 HS descriptors, but this assertion can<br>
 trigger on (and crash) v0 HS authorities. Fixes bug 4411.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha; diagnosed by frosty_un.</li>
<li>  Make bridge authorities not crash when they are asked for their own<br>
 descriptor. Bugfix on 0.2.3.7-alpha, reported by Lucky Green.</li>
<li>  When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain<br>
 wrong) log message that we&#39;re collecting &quot;directory request&quot;<br>
 statistics: clients don&#39;t collect statistics. Also don&#39;t create a<br>
 useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory. Fixes<br>
 bug 4353; bugfix on 0.2.2.34 and 0.2.3.7-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Allow Tor controllers like Vidalia to obtain the microdescriptor<br>
 for a relay by identity digest or nickname. Previously,<br>
 microdescriptors were only available by their own digests, so a<br>
 controller would have to ask for and parse the whole microdescriptor<br>
 consensus in order to look up a single relay&#39;s microdesc. Fixes<br>
 bug 3832; bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha.</li>
<li>  Use OpenSSL&#39;s EVP interface for AES encryption, so that all AES<br>
 operations can use hardware acceleration (if present). Resolves<br>
 ticket 4442.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x and earlier):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Detect failure to initialize Libevent. This fix provides better<br>
 detection for future instances of bug 4457.</li>
<li>  Avoid frequent calls to the fairly expensive cull_wedged_cpuworkers<br>
 function. This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some<br>
 busy servers. Fixes bug 4518; bugfix on 0.0.9.8.</li>
<li>  Don&#39;t warn about unused log_mutex in log.c when building with<br>
 --disable-threads using a recent GCC. Fixes bug 4437; bugfix on<br>
 0.1.0.6-rc which introduced --disable-threads.</li>
<li>  Allow manual &#39;authenticate&#39; commands to the controller interface<br>
 from netcat (nc) as well as telnet. We were rejecting them because<br>
 they didn&#39;t come with the expected whitespace at the end of the<br>
 command. Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha; fixes bug 2893.</li>
<li>  Fix some (not actually triggerable) buffer size checks in usage of<br>
 tor_inet_ntop. Fixes bug 4434; bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Patch<br>
 by Anders Sundman.</li>
<li>  Fix parsing of some corner-cases with tor_inet_pton(). Fixes<br>
 bug 4515; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha; fix by Anders Sundman.</li>
<li>  When configuring, starting, or stopping an NT service, stop<br>
 immediately after the service configuration attempt has succeeded<br>
 or failed. Fixes bug 3963; bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.</li>
<li>  When sending a NETINFO cell, include the original address<br>
 received for the other side, not its canonical address. Found<br>
 by &quot;troll_un&quot;; fixes bug 4349; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>  Rename the bench_{aes,dmap} functions to test_*, so that tinytest<br>
 can pick them up when the tests aren&#39;t disabled. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.2.4-alpha which introduced tinytest.</li>
<li>  Fix a memory leak when we check whether a hidden service<br>
 descriptor has any usable introduction points left. Fixes bug<br>

<ol>
<li>Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>  Fix a memory leak in launch_direct_bridge_descriptor_fetch() that<br>
 occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge<br>
 in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.3.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Make util unit tests build correctly with MSVC. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.3.3-alpha. Patch by Gisle Vanem.</li>
<li>  Successfully detect AUTH_CHALLENGE cells with no recognized<br>
 authentication type listed. Fixes bug 4367; bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.<br>
 Found by frosty_un.</li>
<li>  If a relay receives an AUTH_CHALLENGE cell it can&#39;t answer,<br>
 it should still send a NETINFO cell to allow the connection to<br>
 become open. Fixes bug 4368; fix on 0.2.3.6-alpha; bug found by<br>
 &quot;frosty&quot;.</li>
<li>  Log less loudly when we get an invalid authentication certificate<br>
 from a source other than a directory authority: it&#39;s not unusual<br>
 to see invalid certs because of clock skew. Fixes bug 4370; bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.3.4-alpha and 0.2.3.6-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Add two new config options for directory authorities:<br>
 AuthDirFastGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold for guaranteeing the<br>
 Fast flag, and AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold<br>
 that is always sufficient to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for<br>
 the Guard flag. Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate<br>
 Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.</li>
<li>  When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,<br>
 include the hidden service&#39;s directory in the warning message.<br>
 Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service<br>
 was ignored. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes bug 4426.</li>
<li>  When we fail to initialize Libevent, retry with IOCP disabled so we<br>
 don&#39;t need to turn on multi-threading support in Libevent, which in<br>
 turn requires a working socketpair(). This is a workaround for bug<br>
 4457, which affects Libevent versions from 2.0.1-alpha through<br>
 2.0.15-stable.</li>
<li>  Detect when we try to build on a platform that doesn&#39;t define<br>
 AF_UNSPEC to 0. We don&#39;t work there, so refuse to compile.</li>
<li>  Update to the November 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Make it easier to automate expert package builds on Windows,<br>
 by removing an absolute path from makensis.exe command.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Remove some redundant #include directives throughout the code.<br>
 Patch from Andrea Gelmini.</li>
<li>  Unconditionally use OpenSSL&#39;s AES implementation instead of our<br>
 old built-in one. OpenSSL&#39;s AES has been better for a while, and<br>
 relatively few servers should still be on any version of OpenSSL<br>
 that doesn&#39;t have good optimized assembly AES.</li>
<li>  Use the name &quot;CERTS&quot; consistently to refer to the new cell type;<br>
 we were calling it CERT in some places and CERTS in others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Numerous new unit tests for functions in util.c and address.c by<br>
 Anders Sundman.</li>
<li>  The long-disabled benchmark tests are now split into their own<br>
 ./src/test/bench binary.</li>
<li>  The benchmark tests can now use more accurate timers than<br>
 gettimeofday() when such timers are available.</li>
</ul>

	      <p>The Torouter is the codename for a hardware project that aims to provide users with a device that can easily be configured to run as a Tor bridge or relay. We are currently working on two devices; the <a href="https://www.excito.com/node/9">Excito B3</a> and the <a href="https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/c-5-dreamplugs.aspx">DreamPlug</a>.</p>

<p>Having two devices that are both called &quot;the Torouter&quot; can be a bit confusing, so we would like your help in renaming the Excito B3 Torouter!</p>

<p>The best suggestion will not only be the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter, but the winner will also receive an Excito B3, a Tor t-shirt and stickers. Five runners-up will receive Tor t-shirts and stickers.</p>

<p>To suggest new names for the Excito B3 Torouter, send an email to <em>tor-assistants AT torproject.org</em> with &quot;Torouter naming contest&quot; in the subject. The deadline is December 5, 2011.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We have received a lot of good naming suggestions for the Excito B3 Torouter, thank you to everyone who emailed us! We have decided that the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter is <strong>onionbox</strong>. An email has gone out to the lucky winner of a B3, a t-shirt and some stickers, as well as five-runners up who will all get t-shirts and stickers.</p>
