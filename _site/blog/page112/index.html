          <p>Vidalia 0.2.4 is released. The OS X -alpha bundles are updated to fix a bug in the default &quot;bootstrap&quot; vidalia.conf file that pointed to a non-existent Polipo configuration file, causing Polipo to fail on startup.</p>

<p>The Changelog for this release is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split the message log into &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot; views. The
&quot;Advanced&quot; view contains standard log messages from Tor, while the new
experimental &quot;Basic&quot; view displays status events received from Tor.
(Ticket #265)</li>
<li>Apply an application-global stylesheet on OS X that forces all tree
widgets in Vidalia to use the 12pt font recommended by Apple&#39;s human
interface guidelines.</li>
<li>Add an OSX_FORCE_32BIT CMake option that can be used to force a 32-bit
build on Mac OS X versions that default to 64-bit builds (e.g., Snow
Leopard), if only 32-bit versions of the Qt libraries are available.</li>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in 0.2.3 that prevented Vidalia from correctly
responding to ADDRMAP events from Tor. The result was that users would
sometimes see IP addresses in the connection list shown under the network
map rather than hostnames.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the default &quot;bootstrap&quot; vidalia.conf file included in the
OS X drag-and-drop bundles that pointed to a non-existent Polipo
configuration file, causing Polipo to fail on startup.</li>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Throughout the summer I&#39;ve been working on a project called &#39;arm&#39; (which stands for the &#39;anonymizing relay monitor&#39;). It&#39;s a real-time, terminal monitor for Tor relays providing bandwidth/cpu/memory usage, relay configuration, event log, connections, and other details relay operators might find handy for checking Tor&#39;s status. The project&#39;s intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone stuck with a tty terminal.</p>

<p>Source, screen shots, and a development log are available on the <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm">project&#39;s page</a> and an interview by Brenno Winter discussing the project is available <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/HFM_INT_0001.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p>The summer started with <a href="http://www.atagar.com/misc/gsocBlog09/">an application</a> to <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">GSoC 2009</a>. Though it wasn&#39;t accepted, in retrospect I wouldn&#39;t change a thing since looking for alternative ideas eventually led me to <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2008/msg00005.html">a thread by Jacob and Karsten from 2008</a> proposing a terminal relay monitor. Coding it has been a fantastic experience, providing the opportunity to dabble in a couple areas that are utterly new to me.</p>

<p>First, all my past experience with Python came from writing small scripts. However, what Jacob had termed a &quot;weekend project&quot; has grown to over 3,000 lines, with all the design and refactoring goodness that comes along with it. In particular this meant learning in intimate detail just how &quot;curses&quot; earned its name and writing wrappers to make up for its shortcomings.</p>

<p>Second, this was my first time working with an active, established open source community. While development was still mostly hacking out code amid Voodoo Daddy swing, having a community to bounce ideas off of and provide feedback made the work vastly more interesting and worthwhile. It was also my first experiences with anonymity systems and I&#39;d *highly* suggest the PETS conference to any future students interested in the field.</p>

<p>Barring the occasional bug fix or feature request the arm project is pretty well done so I&#39;m next off to the dreaded task of job hunting. Though I&#39;ll need to pull back the time I contribute to Tor, I&#39;m still hoping to stay active in the community. Thanks for the excellent summer - cheers! -Damian</p>

          <p>On August 27th, we released Vidalia 0.2.3. This fixes some more bugs with &quot;Who has used by bridge&quot; functionality and switches to Qt signals for event handling.</p>

<p>The updated Vidalia packages can be found at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia" title="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia">https://www.torproject.org/vidalia</a></p>

<p>The changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the data directory before trying to copy over the default
Vidalia configuration file from inside the application bundle on Mac
OS X. Affects only OS X drag-and-drop installer users without a
previous Vidalia installation.</li>
<li>Change all Tor event handling to use Qt&#39;s signals and slots mechanism
instead of custom QEvent subclasses.</li>
<li>Fix another bug that resulted in the &quot;Who has used my bridge?&quot; link
initially being visible when the user clicks &quot;Setup Relaying&quot; from
the control panel if they are running a non-bridge relay.
(Ticket #509, reported by &quot;vrapp&quot;)</li>
<li>Always hide the &quot;Who has used my bridge?&quot; link when Tor isn&#39;t running,
since clicking it won&#39;t return useful information until Tor actually
is running.</li>

          <p>As highlighted in the <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0221alpha-released">0.2.2.1-alpha release notes</a>, the Vidalia Bundle for OS X includes some major changes. Many of these are for ease of use and user experience improvements. The release of OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) gave me a fine excuse to release the improvements.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-osx.html.en#uninstall">un-install Tor/Vidalia</a> and then install this new bundle; rather than upgrade. If you want to upgrade, you&#39;ll need to update the paths for Tor and Polipo in the Vidalia Settings window.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of testing since this <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/experimental-os-x-drag-and-drop-vidalia-bundle-installer">test release</a> of the drag and drop installer for OS X in January. The main goal was to make installation far easier, less error prone, and keep all of the bundle in a single directory for easier configuration and un-installation.</p>

<p>The changes are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade Vidalia from 0.1.15 to 0.2.3 in the Windows and OS X installer bundles. See <a href="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHANGELOG" title="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHANGELOG">https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHAN...</a> for details of what&#39;s new in Vidalia 0.2.3.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: move to Polipo 1.0.4 with Tor specific configuration file, rather than the old Privoxy.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: Vidalia, Tor, and Polipo are compiled as x86-only for better compatibility with OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: The multi-package installer is now replaced by a simple drag and drop to the /Applications folder. This change occurred with the upgrade to Vidalia 0.2.3.</li>
</ul>

          <p>Tor 0.2.2.1-alpha disables &quot;.exit&quot; address notation by default, allows
Tor clients to bootstrap on networks where only port 80 is reachable,
makes it more straightforward to support hardware crypto accelerators,
and starts the groundwork for gathering stats safely at relays.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve been improving our packages and bundles:
<strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade Vidalia from 0.1.15 to 0.2.3 in the Windows and OS X
installer bundles. See
<a href="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHANGELOG" title="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHANGELOG">https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.2.3/CHAN...</a>
for details of what&#39;s new in Vidalia 0.2.3.</li>
<li>Windows Vidalia Bundle: update Privoxy from 3.0.6 to 3.0.14-beta.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: move to Polipo 1.0.4 with Tor specific
configuration file, rather than the old Privoxy.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: Vidalia, Tor, and Polipo are compiled as
x86-only for better compatibility with OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard.</li>
<li>OS X Tor Expert Bundle: Tor is compiled as x86-only for
better compatibility with OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard.</li>
<li>OS X Vidalia Bundle: The multi-package installer is now replaced
by a simple drag and drop to the /Applications folder. This change
occurred with the upgrade to Vidalia 0.2.3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.1-alpha - 2009-08-26
<strong>Security fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Start the process of disabling &quot;.exit&quot; address notation, since it
can be used for a variety of esoteric application-level attacks
on users. To reenable it, set &quot;AllowDotExit 1&quot; in your torrc. Fix
on 0.0.9rc5.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up urras (run by Jacob Appelbaum) as the seventh v3 directory
authority.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New AccelName and AccelDir options add support for dynamic OpenSSL
hardware crypto acceleration engines.</li>
<li>Tor now supports tunneling all of its outgoing connections over
a SOCKS proxy, using the SOCKS4Proxy and/or SOCKS5Proxy
configuration options. Code by Christopher Davis.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Send circuit or stream sendme cells when our window has decreased
by 100 cells, not when it has decreased by 101 cells. Bug uncovered
by Karsten when testing the &quot;reduce circuit window&quot; performance
patch. Bugfix on the 54th commit on Tor -- from July 2002,
before the release of Tor 0.0.0. This is the new winner of the
oldest-bug prize.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New options for gathering stats safely:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Directories that set &quot;DirReqStatistics 1&quot; write statistics on
directory request to disk every 24 hours. As compared to the
--enable-geoip-stats flag in 0.2.1.x, there are a few improvements:
1) stats are written to disk exactly every 24 hours; 2) estimated
shares of v2 and v3 requests are determined as mean values, not at
the end of a measurement period; 3) unresolved requests are listed
with country code &#39;??&#39;; 4) directories also measure download times.</li>
<li>Exit nodes that set &quot;ExitPortStatistics 1&quot; write statistics on the
number of exit streams and transferred bytes per port to disk every
24 hours.</li>
<li>Relays that set &quot;CellStatistics 1&quot; write statistics on how long
cells spend in their circuit queues to disk every 24 hours.</li>
<li>Entry nodes that set &quot;EntryStatistics 1&quot; write statistics on the
rough number and origins of connecting clients to disk every 24
hours.</li>
<li>Relays that write any of the above statistics to disk and set
&quot;ExtraInfoStatistics 1&quot; include the past 24 hours of statistics in
their extra-info documents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New --digests command-line switch to output the digests of the
source files Tor was built with.</li>
<li>The &quot;torify&quot; script now uses torsocks where available.</li>
<li>The memarea code now uses a sentinel value at the end of each area
to make sure nothing writes beyond the end of an area. This might
help debug some conceivable causes of bug 930.</li>
<li>Time and memory units in the configuration file can now be set to
fractional units. For example, &quot;2.5 GB&quot; is now a valid value for
AccountingMax.</li>
<li>Certain Tor clients (such as those behind check.torproject.org) may
want to fetch the consensus in an extra early manner. To enable this
a user may now set FetchDirInfoExtraEarly to 1. This also depends on
setting FetchDirInfoEarly to 1. Previous behavior will stay the same
as only certain clients who must have this information sooner should
set this option.</li>
<li>Instead of adding the svn revision to the Tor version string, report
the git commit (when we&#39;re building from a git checkout).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If any the v3 certs we download are unparseable, we should actually
notice the failure so we don&#39;t retry indefinitely. Bugfix on
0.2.0.x; reported by &quot;rotator&quot;.</li>
<li>If the cached cert file is unparseable, warn but don&#39;t exit.</li>
<li>Fix possible segmentation fault on directory authorities. Bugfix on
0.2.1.14-rc.</li>
<li>When Tor fails to parse a descriptor of any kind, dump it to disk.
Might help diagnosing bug 1051.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deprecated and removed features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The controller no longer accepts the old obsolete &quot;addr-mappings/&quot;
or &quot;unregistered-servers-&quot; GETINFO values.</li>
<li>Hidden services no longer publish version 0 descriptors, and clients
do not request or use version 0 descriptors. However, the old hidden
service authorities still accept and serve version 0 descriptors
when contacted by older hidden services/clients.</li>
<li>The EXTENDED_EVENTS and VERBOSE_NAMES controller features are now
always on; using them is necessary for correct forward-compatible
controllers.</li>
<li>Remove support for .noconnect style addresses. Nobody was using
them, and they provided another avenue for detecting Tor users
via application-level web tricks.</li>
</ul>
