          <p><p>2011 was an exciting year for communications security. Online communications helped to support activists in the Middle East&#39;s &quot;Arab Spring&quot; as they toppled Tunisia&#39;s Ben Ali and Egypt&#39;s Mubarak. Tor&#39;s entry nodes and hidden &quot;bridge&quot; entry points have seen <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">increased usage</a> from Iran and Syria, as citizens there seek to communicate securely and evade government censorship. Secretary of State Clinton has made Internet Freedom part of the U.S. State Department&#39;s agenda, while here in the United States, advertisers have developed more sophisticated ways to track browsers&#39; online activity.</p>

<p>The Tor Project can help, but the censors and snoops are never very far behind. We must keep improving our software and network, researching its security against new threats, and training users to communicate safely. As a non-profit, we depend on your donations of money, relays, and advocacy to keep making progress.</p>

<p>In the past year, Tor released new versions to improve security and blocking resistance, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix">including a same-day fix</a> to a block detected in Iran. We have enhanced translations in more than a dozen languages including Farsi, Arabic, and Chinese; presented security and anonymity research; and taught security practices to groups including journalists, activists, law enforcement, and survivors of domestic violence.</p>

<p>Please help us keep the Internet open and private for all.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep up to date with Tor, please visit our donor thank you page at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/thankyou" title="https://www.torproject.org/donate/thankyou">https://www.torproject.org/donate/thankyou</a>.</p>

          <p><p>Update 2011-12-21 20:06 (GMT-5): everything is back online and operating within acceptable parameters.</p>

<p>As of late last night 20 Dec (GMT-5) our website hosting provider is
experiencing a sustained attack. The attack is not directed at Tor, but
someone else on the same network. The effect is that parts of our
website infrastructure are intermittently unreachable. This includes
the following domains in torproject.org: www, trac, gitweb, doxygen,
cloud, svn, and check.</p>

<p>The most visible outage is check.torproject.org. Every Tor Browser
Bundle user will attempt to reach this url on start up. You are
currently seeing a browser-generated timeout message as the site is
unreachable.</p>

<p>We&#39;re working to setup a new instance of check.torproject.org on a
different machine today.</p>

          <p><p>We are happy to announce the launch of the <a href="https://fa-blog.torproject.org/">Tor Farsi blog</a>. The site is created in response to the great reception of Tor and circumvention tools amongst Iranian users. The goal of this site is to be a one-stop place to find Tor related material in Farsi.</p>

<p>The Farsi team will translate white papers, summaries of select posts, and important updates relevant to Tor. We want to create a community of Farsi-speaking Tor users and empower them with information about anonymity and privacy on the Internet. We hope this community will spread this information to others to help them with their Internet anonymity and privacy needs.</p>

          <p><p><strong>Tor 0.2.3.10-alpha fixes a critical heap-overflow security issue in
 Tor&#39;s buffers code. Absolutely everybody should upgrade.</strong></p>

<p>The bug relied on an incorrect calculation when making data continuous
 in one of our IO buffers, if the first chunk of the buffer was
 misaligned by just the wrong amount. The miscalculation would allow an
 attacker to overflow a piece of heap-allocated memory. To mount this
 attack, the attacker would need to either open a SOCKS connection to
 Tor&#39;s SocksPort (usually restricted to localhost), or target a Tor
 instance configured to make its connections through a SOCKS proxy
 (which Tor does not do by default).</p>

<p>Good security practice requires that all heap-overflow bugs should be
 presumed to be exploitable until proven otherwise, so we are treating
 this as a potential code execution attack. Please upgrade immediately!
 This bug does not affect bufferevents-based builds of Tor. Special
 thanks to &quot;Vektor&quot; for reporting this issue to us!</p>

<p>This release also contains a few minor bugfixes for issues discovered
 in 0.2.3.9-alpha.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.3.10-alpha - 2011-12-16</strong></p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a heap overflow bug that could occur when trying to pull
data into the first chunk of a buffer, when that chunk had
already had some data drained from it. Fixes CVE-2011-2778;
bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by &quot;Vektor&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we can&#39;t attach streams to a rendezvous circuit when we
finish connecting to a hidden service, clear the rendezvous
circuit&#39;s stream-isolation state and try to attach streams
again. Previously, we cleared rendezvous circuits&#39; isolation
state either too early (if they were freshly built) or not at all
(if they had been built earlier and were cannibalized). Bugfix on
0.2.3.3-alpha; fixes bug 4655.</li>
<li>Fix compilation of the libnatpmp helper on non-Windows. Bugfix on
0.2.3.9-alpha; fixes bug 4691. Reported by Anthony G. Basile.</li>
<li>Fix an assertion failure when a relay with accounting enabled
starts up while dormant. Fixes bug 4702; bugfix on 0.2.3.9-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Update to the December 6 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>
