            <h2>Academic (Postdoc, PhD, and Master's) positions available for Tor-related research</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Sep 2011</p>

<div class="event">
<p>As more anonymous communications and PETs researchers join the academic ranks, there is an increasing availability of Tor-related research positions at the postdoctoral, PhD, and Master&#39;s levels. (Note: we prefer the term &quot;training of Highly Qualified Personnel&quot; to &quot;pyramid scheme&quot;.)</p>

<p>Steven Murdoch (at Cambridge) and I (at Waterloo) each have some such positions available. See information and links below.</p>

</dd>
<dt><strong>PhD and Master's positions at Waterloo</strong></dt>
<dd>One of the particular focuses of the Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) group at the University of Waterloo is research into privacy-enhancing technologies and anonymous communication networks. We have much ongoing work on Tor, with an eye to improving its security, privacy, scalability, and performance.
<p>Students interested in applying for PhD and Master's research positions in the CrySP group should email Ian Goldberg <a href="mailto:iang@cs.uwaterloo.ca" rel="nofollow">&lt;iang@cs.uwaterloo.ca&gt;</a> with "Tor research position" in the subject line.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Postdoc position at Waterloo</strong></dt>
<dd>The Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) research group at the University of Waterloo is seeking applications for a postdoctoral research position in the field of privacy-enhancing technologies, preferably on the topic of privacy-preserving communications systems. This position will be held in the Cheriton School of Computer Science.
<p>Applicants must hold a PhD in a related field, and should have a proven research record, as demonstrated by publications in top security and privacy venues (such as Oakland, CCS, USENIX Security, and NDSS) and/or top venues specific to privacy-enhancing technologies (such as PETS).</p>
<p>The start date of the position is negotiable. The position may be for one or two years.</p>
<p>Applicants should submit a CV, a research plan, two or three selected papers, and the names and contact information of three references.</p>
<p>For further information about the position, or to apply, please send email to Ian Goldberg <a href="mailto:iang@cs.uwaterloo.ca" rel="nofollow">&lt;iang@cs.uwaterloo.ca&gt;</a> with "Postdoctoral position" in the subject line. Applications may be considered as they arrive.</p>
