          <p><p>The latest version of the anonymous operating system Tails is now available.</p>

<p>Notable user-visible changes include:</p>

<h2>Tor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade to 0.2.2.34. This fixes CVE-2011-2768 and CVE-2011-2769 which prompted for manual updates for users of Tails 0.8.1.</li>
<li><p>Suppress Tor&#39;s warning about applications doing their own DNS lookups. Some users have reported concerns about these warnings, but it should be noted that they are completely harmless inside Tails as its system DNS resolver is Torified.</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux 3.0.0-6, which fixed a great number of bugs and security issues.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Iceweasel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade to 3.5.16-11 ((fixes CVE-2011-3647, CVE-2011-3648, CVE-2011-3650).</li>
<li>Torbutton: upgrade to 1.4.4.1-1, including support for the in-browser &quot;New identity&quot; feature.</li>
<li>FireGPG: upgrade to 0.8-1+tails2. Users are notified that the FireGPG Text Editor is the only safe place for performing cryptographic operations, and these operations has been disabled in other places. Performing them outside of the editor opens up several severe attacks through JavaScript (e.g. leaking plaintext when decrypting, signing messages written by the attacker).</li>
<li>Replace CS Lite with Cookie Monster for cookie management. Cookie Monster has an arguably nicer interface, is being actively maintained and is packaged in Debian.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software</h2>

<ul>
<li>Install MAT, the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit. Its goal is to remove file metadata which otherwise could leak information about you in the documents and media files you publish. This is the result of a Tails developer&#39;s suggestion for GSoC 2011, although it ended up being mentored by The Tor Project.</li>
<li>Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5~rc1. Users are guided how to send their bug reports through alternative channels upon errors sending them. This will make bug reporting easier when there&#39;s no network connection available.</li>
<li>Upgrade TrueCrypt to 7.1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
<li>The date and time setting system was completely reworked. This should prevent time syncing issues that may prevent Tor from working properly, which some users have reported. The new system will not leave a fingerprintable network signature, like the old system did. Previously that signature could be used to identify who is using Tails (but not deanonymize them).</li>
<li>Erase memory at shutdown: run many instances of the memory wiper. Due to architectural limitations of i386 a process cannot access all memory at the same time, and hence a single memory wipe instance cannot clear all memory.</li>
<li>Saner keyboard layouts for Arabic and Russian.</li>
<li>Use Plymouth text-only splash screen at boot time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus the usual bunch of minor bug reports and improvements. The full <a href="http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.9">technical changelog</a> is available.</p>

          <p><p>Tor currently transports data over encrypted TLS tunnels between nodes, in turn carried by TCP. This has worked reasonably well, but recent research has shown that it might not be the best option, particularly for performance.</p>

<p>For example, when a packet gets dropped or corrupted on a link between two Tor nodes, TCP will cause the packet to be retransmitted eventually. However, in the meantime, all circuits passing through this pair of nodes will be stalled, not only the circuit corresponding to the packet which was dropped.</p>

<p>Also, Tor uses two levels of congestion control; TCP for hop-by-hop links, and a custom scheme for circuits. This might not be the right approach -- maybe these schemes aren&#39;t the right ones to use or maybe there should only be one level of congestion control.</p>

<p>There have been a variety of solutions proposed to fix one or both of these problems, Most end up sending data as datagrams in UDP packets, and Tor is responsible for managing congestion and recovering from packet loss, and so can (hopefully) do so in a more intelligent way. However, there are many options for what architecture to use, what building blocks to build these schemes from, and how to tweak the many parameters that result.</p>

<p>To help clarify the various options, I&#39;ve written a summary of both Tor&#39;s current network stack architecture and various proposals for how it can be improved. The document discusses various tradeoffs between the approaches, including performance, security, and engineering difficulties in deploying the solution. It ends with some provisional conclusions about which options are most promising.</p>

<p>The document, “ <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Esjm217/papers/tor11datagramcomparison.pdf">Comparison of Tor Datagram Designs</a>”, is now available (with source in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/sjm217/torspec.git/tree/datagram_comparison:/proposals/ideas/xxx-datagram-comparison">git</a>), and I would welcome comments. Over the next few months I&#39;ll be working on building and evaluating prototypes for these schemes, and I will be incorporating feedback from the Tor community into the process.</p>

          <p><p>Tor 0.2.3.7-alpha fixes a crash bug in 0.2.3.6-alpha introduced by the new v3 handshake. It also resolves yet another bridge address enumeration issue.</p>

<p>All packages are updated, with the exception of the OS X PPC packages. The build machine is down and packages will be built as soon as it is back online.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.3.7-alpha - 2011-10-30
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,
don&#39;t process any further cells on it. We already avoid further
reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the
cells we&#39;d already read. Fixes bug 4299; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha,
which was the first version where we might mark a connection for
close based on processing a cell on it.</li>
<li>Fix a double-free bug that would occur when we received an invalid
certificate in a CERT cell in the new v3 handshake. Fixes bug 4343;
bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Bridges no longer include their address in NETINFO cells on outgoing
OR connections, to allow them to blend in better with clients.
Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Reported by
&quot;troll_un&quot;. Fixes bug 4348; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha, when NETINFO
cells were introduced.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trivial fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a typo in a hibernation-related log message. Fixes bug 4331;
bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by &quot;tmpname0901&quot;.</li>
</ul>
