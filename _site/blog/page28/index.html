          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>News from the browser team front</h1>

<p>Mike Perry has a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000438.html">detailed report</a> about what the growing Tor Browser team has been up to. Among the good news, new fingerprinting defenses are getting close to be merged for “screen resolution, default character sets, site permissions, and local service enumeration”. Some other changes that will reduce the attack surface include “disabling addon update requests for addons that should not update, a potential fix for a disk leak in the browser’s video cache, […], and a potential fix to prevent the Flash plugin from being loaded into the browser at all until the user actually requests to use it.”</p>

<p>Most censored users currently have to use a separate browser bundle dubbed “pluggable transports bundle”. This has proven quite inconvenient for both users and those trying to support them. Mike reports progress on “unifying the pluggable transport bundles with the official bundles, so that both censored and uncensored users can use the same bundles. […] The progress is sufficient that we are very likely to be able to deploy a 3.6-beta1 release in February to test these unified bundles.”</p>

<p>Another important topic is how the privacy fixes in the Tor Browser can benefit a wider userbase. The team has “continued the merge process with Mozilla, and have worked to ensure that every patch of ours is on their radar […]. Two patches, one for an API we require to manage the Tor subprocess, and another to give us a filter to remove potentially dangerous drag-and-drop events to the desktop have already been merged. Next steps will include filing more bugs, continual contact with their development team, and touching up patches as needed.”</p>

<p>There are even more things to smile about in the report. Read it in full for the whole picture.</p>

<h1>Key revocation in next generation hidden services</h1>

<p>It looks like every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_infrastructure">public-key infrastructure</a> struggles with how to handle key revocation. Hidden services are no different. The current design completely ignored preventing a stolen key from being reused by an attacker.</p>

<p>With the on-going effort to create a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt">new protocol for hidden services</a>, now seems to be a good time for George Kadianakis to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006146.html">raise this issue</a>. In the past there was little control for the hidden services operators over their secret key. The new design enables offline management operations which include key revocation.</p>

<p>As George puts it, currently well-known solutions “are always messy and don’t work really well (look at SSL’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRLs</a>).” So how can “the legitimate Hidden Service can inform a client that its keys got compromised”?</p>

<p>In his email, George describes two solutions, one relying on the directory authorities, the other on hidden service directories. Both have drawbacks, so perhaps further research is necessary.</p>

<p>In the same thread, Nick Hopper <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006149.html">suggested</a> a scheme that uses multiple hidden service directories to cross-certify their revocation lists. This gives more confidence to the user, since the adversary now has to compromise multiple hidden service directories.</p>

<p>Please join the discussion if you have ideas to share!</p>

<h1>Help needed to remove DNS leaks from Mumble</h1>

<p><a href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/">Mumble</a> is a “low-latency, high quality voice chat software primarily intended for use while gaming”.</p>

<p>It’s proven to be a reliable solution for voice chat among multiple parties over Tor. Matt and Colin have worked on a documentation on how to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Mumble">setup both the client and the server side</a> for Tor users.<br>
 But the client is currently safely usable only on Linux system with torsocks and on Tails. On other operating systems, the Mumble client will unfortunately <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1033">leak the address of the server to the local DNS resolver</a>.</p>

<p>The changes that need to be made to the Mumble code are less trivial than one would think. Matt describe the issue in more details in his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006158.html">call for help</a>. Have a look if you are up to some C++/Qt hacking.</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for January 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000435.html">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000436.html">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000437.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000438.html">Tor Browser team</a> from Mike Perry, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000439.html">Colin C.</a>, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000440.html">help desk</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000441.html">Matt</a>. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000442.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000443.html">George Kadianakis</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000445.html">Pearl Crescent</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006157.html">came up</a> with <a href="https://github.com/nmathewson/mmdb-convert">a Python script</a> to convert the new MaxMind GeoIP2 binary database to the format used by Tor for its geolocation database.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-February/000464.html">John Ricketts from Quintex Alliance Consulting</a> for providing another mirror for the Tor Project’s website and software.</p>

<p>Abhiram Chintangal and Oliver Baumann are <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006142.html">reporting</a> progress on their <a href="https://github.com/baumanno/tor-weather-rewrite">rewrite</a> of the Tor Weather service.</p>

<p>Andreas Jonsson gave <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031959.html">an update</a> on how Mozilla is moving to a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=925570">multi-process model for Firefox</a> and how this should positively affect the possibility of sandboxing the Tor Browser in the future.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006061.html">planned</a>, to help “developers to analyze the directory protocol and for researchers to understand what information is available to clients to make path selection decisions”, Karsten Loesing <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006141.html">has made</a> microdescriptor archives available on the metrics website.</p>

<p>Christian has <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032012.html">deployed</a> a <a href="https://globe-node.herokuapp.com/">test platform</a> for the JavaScript-less version of Globe, a tool to retrieve information about the Tor network and its relays.</p>

<p>In an answer to Shadowman’s questions about pluggable transports, George Kadianakis wrote a detailed reply on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031984.html">how Tor manages pluggable transports</a>, both on the server side an on the client side.</p>

<p>Arthur D. Edelstein has <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032010.html">advertised a GreaseMonkey script</a> to enable Tor Browser to access YouTube videos without having JavaScript enabled. Please be aware of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031623.html">security risks that GreaseMonkey might introduce</a> before using such a solution.</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman reports on his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000434.html">trip to Washington DC</a> where he met Spitfire Strategies to learn about “Tor’s brand, media presence, and ideas for the future”. For a short excerpt: “It’s interesting to get critiques on all our past media appearances; what was good and what could be better. Overall, the team there are doing a great job.”</p>

<p>Lunar <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000444.html">accounted</a> for Tor’s presence at FOSDEM, one of the largest free software event in Europe. The project had a <a href="https://twitter.com/anthraxx42/status/429600652399247361">small booth</a> shared with Mozilla and there was even a <a href="https://twitter.com/FrennVunDerEnn/status/429636610603233280">relay operator meetup</a>.</p>

<p>Yan Zhu has <a href="https://lists.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere/2014-February/001964.html">released</a> the first version of HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox Mobile. A good news for users of <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/Orfox">the upcoming Orfox</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users often want to know if Tor can make them appear to be coming from a particular country. Although doing so can reduce one’s anonymity, it is <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#ChooseEntryExit">documented on our FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p>Orbot users have noticed that installing Orbot to their SD storage can cause Orbot to stop functioning correctly. Installing Orbot to the internal storage has resolved issues for a few users.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Rhin is <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1402/88">looking for hidden services hosting services</a>. Jens pointed them to ahmia.fi but it looks like no there are no gratis hidden services hosters currently available.</p>

<p>Vijay kudal wanted to know how to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1438/1041">change the current circuit within shell scripts</a>. Jens Kubieziel gave an <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/1453/88">answer using expect and hexdump</a>.</p>

<p>Roya saw <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1439/88">check.torproject.org replying contradictory information</a> with Atlas about the exit node being used. It seems to be a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10499#comment:4">bug in check</a> occuring when multiple nodes are using the same IP address.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the fourth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser Bundle 3.5.1 is released</h1>

<p>An update to the Tor Browser Bundle <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-351-released">has been released</a> on January 27th. The new release contains Tor 0.2.4.20 which fixes <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10456">a bug creating useless extra circuits</a>. It also fixes a denial of service condition in OpenSSL and removes “addons.mozilla.org” from the NoScript whitelist.</p>

<p>Arabic bundles are back after a short hiatus. Support for screen readers is also enabled again and has been <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031575.html">confirmed working</a>.</p>

<p>HTTPS Everywhere has been updated to version 3.4.5. It contains a new rule to secure connections to Stack Exchange and its <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/">Tor corner</a>.</p>

<p>Look at the blog post for a more detailed changelog. And now, head over to the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">download page</a> and upgrade!</p>

<h1>New Tor denial of service attacks and defenses</h1>

<p>Rob Jansen, Florian Tschorsch, Aaron Johnson, and Björn Scheuermann have been working on a new paper entitled <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ejansen/publications/sniper-ndss2014.pdf">The Sniper Attack: Anonymously Deanonymizing and Disabling the Tor Network</a>. As research papers are sometimes hard to fully understand, Rob Jansen has published a new <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-denial-service-attacks-and-defenses">blog post</a> giving an overview of the attacks, the defenses, what has been modified in Tor so far, and what open questions remain.</p>

<p>“We found a new vulnerability in the design of Tor’s flow control algorithm that can be exploited to remotely crash Tor relays. The attack is an extremely low resource attack in which an adversary’s bandwidth may be traded for a target relay’s memory (RAM) at an amplification rate of one to two orders of magnitude” explains Rob.</p>

<p>The authors have been working with Tor developers on integrating defenses before publishing: “Due to our devastating findings, we also<br>
 designed three defenses that mitigate our attacks, one of which provably renders the attack ineffective. Defenses have been implemented and deployed into the Tor software to ensure that the Tor network is no longer vulnerable as of Tor version 0.2.4.18-rc and later.”</p>

<p>Be sure to read the blog post and the paper in full if you want to know more.</p>

<h1>Good times at Real World Crypto 2014</h1>

<p>On the second week of January, a bunch of Tor developers attended the <a href="https://realworldcrypto.wordpress.com/">Real World Crypto workshop</a> in New York City.</p>

<p>The workshop featured a nice blend of industry and academic crypto talks and a fruitful hallway track. Many researchers involved with Tor and privacy technologies were also present.</p>

<p>As far as talks were concerned, Tom Shrimpton presented the <a href="https://fteproxy.org/">Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) traffic obfuscation tool</a> which is currently being developed to <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10362">work as a Tor pluggable transport</a>. The Tor developers present also worked with Kevin Dyer, one of the paper authors and developers of FTE, towards including FTE in the Pluggable Transport Tor bundles.</p>

<p>On the censorship circumvention front, I2P developers showed interest in using pluggable transports. Work has been done to identify various problems with the current PT spec that need to be fixed so that other projects can <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10629">use pluggable transports more smoothly</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there were talks with the developers of <a href="https://uproxy.org/">UProxy</a> (a censorship circumvention tool made by Google) and helped them understand how pluggable transports work and what they would need to do if they wanted to use them in UProxy. They seemed interested and motivated to work on this.</p>

<p>The Tor developers also worked on the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt">Next Generation Hidden Services</a> project, and sketched out some ways to move forward even though there are some <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006099.html">open research questions</a> with the current design.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson commented on IRC: “I think the hallway track to main conference utility ratio was higher than usual, since the conference actually sticks practitioners and cryptographers in the same room pretty reliably.” Let’s hope for next year!</p>

<h1>The media and some terminology</h1>

<p>BusinessWeek published <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-23/tor-anonymity-software-vs-dot-the-national-security-agency">The inside story of Tor, the best Internet anonymity tool the government ever built</a>. Better that what one can usually read about Tor in the press, the piece — courtesy of Dune Lawrence — still sparkled a discussion on the tor-talk mailing list <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031863.html">about terminology</a>.</p>

<p>Katya Titov quoted a misleading part of the article: “In addition to facilitating anonymous communication online, Tor is an access point to the ‘dark Web’, vast reaches of the Internet that are intentionally kept hidden and don’t show up in Google or other search engines, […].”</p>

<p>As references to the “dark web”, the “deep web”, or the “dark deep shady Knockturn Alley of the Internet” have been popping up more and more in the media over the past months, Katya wanted to come up with proper definitions of commonly misunderstood terms to reduce misinformation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a>.</p>

<p>She summarized the result of the discussion in a new <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HowBigIsTheDarkWeb">HowBigIsTheDarkWeb</a> wiki page. Be sure to point it to your fellow journalists!</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>To follow up on last week’s Tor Weekly News coverage, Philipp Winter wrote a blog post to explain <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-spoiled-onions-paper-means-tor-users">what the “Spoiled Onions” paper means for Tor users</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sukhbir Singh, users with @outlook.com email addresses can now <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/6591#comment:4">request bridges and bundles via email</a>.</p>

<p>Karsten Loesing <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10699#comment:3">dug some statistics</a> about the Tor Weather service. There are currently 1846 different email addresses subscribed for 2349 Tor relays.</p>

<p>Tor developers will be <a href="https://twitter.com/torproject/status/427922491948818432">present</a> at the Mozilla booth during FOSDEM’14 . Drop by if you have questions or want to get involved in Tor!</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users repeatedly contact Tor help desk about unreachable hidden services. If that happens, please first make sure the system clock is accurate and try to visit the <a href="http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/">hidden service for the Tor Project’s website</a> (<code>idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion</code>). If it works, it means that Tor is working as it should and there’s nothing more the Tor Project can do. Hidden services are solely under the responsibility of their operators and they are the only one that can do something when a hidden service goes offline.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Alex Ryan has been experiencing <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1302/88">crashes of his relay running on a Raspberry Pi</a> due to circuit creation storms. He found out that the problem disappeared after upgrading to the new 0.2.4 series of Tor. There are currently no official Raspbian packages, so users will have to build the package manually from source.</p>

<p>User cypherpunks wanted to know <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1339/88">how to report security issues to the Tor Project</a>. Until <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9186">a proper process is decided</a>, the best way at the moment is to contact Nick Mathewson, Andrea Shepard, or Roger Dingledine privately using their GnuPG keys.</p>

<p><a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1337/88">How many hidden services can be served from a single Tor instance?</a> Syrian Watermelon is looking to know if there is a hard limit and how memory usage will go. The question is still open and has attracted some interest from other users.</p>
