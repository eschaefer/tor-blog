          <p><p>I was invited to talk for 90 minutes at NNEDV&#39;s <a href="http://nnedv.org/projects/safetynet/3701-techsummit2013.html">TechSummit 13</a> about privacy, helping victims, and Tor. My <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-07-30-NNEDV-Presentation.pdf">presentation</a> covered a quick overview of Tor, why I&#39;m here talking about domestic violence and intimate partner abuse, and what we&#39;re doing to help. I also included four case studies of which highlight the role of technology in stalking and abuse. Videos of my talk may make their way online at some point. At the request of the audience, I walked through my <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-01-27-WorldBank-fuerza-presentation.html">World Bank Hackathon</a> presentation to show how easy it is to infect a mobile phone and what an abuser will get out of such an action.</p>

<p>The conference was held at the great <a href="http://www.hayesmansion.com/">Hayes Mansion</a> which allowed for lots of informal conversations in a more relaxed atmosphere. The attendees are a mix of advocates from around the world, law enforcement, commercial companies (such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Verizon, Mozilla, etc), and a number of lawyers from public and private organizations.</p>

<p>I could only stay for one of the three-day conference, but once again, it was great to engage in conversations with people of all backgrounds. Many organizations are now more aware of Tor and interested in talking to us about using our technology and experience to help. Hopefully our continuing commitment to helping and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/ipv">past experience</a> in this area are beginning to make a difference.</p>

<p>Overall, it was great to be invited and worth the trip.</p>

          <p><p>Welcome to the 6<sup>th</sup> issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the resilient Tor community.</p>

<h1>Large hidden services provider compromised, attacks older TBB versions</h1>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting">Andrew Lewman wrote</a>: “Around midnight on August 4th we were notified by a few people that a large number of hidden service addresses have disappeared from the Tor network.”</p>

<p>It turned out that Freedom Hosting, a company specializing in hosting websites accessible through Tor hidden services, was compromised. As Andrew puts it, “From what is known so far, the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of JavaScript exploit in the web pages delivered to users. This exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect user’s computers.” Andrew also reiterated that “the person, or persons, who run Freedom Hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to The Tor Project, Inc., the organization coordinating the development of the Tor software and research”.</p>

<p>The Tor Browser is currently based on Mozilla Firefox 17 ESR. With the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/08/04/investigating-security-vulnerability-report/">help of Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://tsyrklevich.net/tbb_payload.txt">other researchers</a> it was understood that the exploit used a vulnerability in Firefox JavaScript engine to attack Windows users of the Tor Browser Bundle. This vulnerability was <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-53.html">fixed in Firefox 17.0.7 ESR</a> and subsequently in versions 2.3.25-10 ( <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages">released June 26 2013</a>), 2.4.15-alpha-1 ( <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages">released June 26 2013</a>) 3.0alpha2 ( <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released">released June 30 2013</a>) and 2.4.15-beta-1 ( <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02415-rc-packages-available">released July 8 2013</a>).</p>

<p>Users running updated versions, and those who have disabled JavaScript, are not affected by the exploit.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine issued a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html">security advisory</a> with advice to mitigate future issues: “be sure you’re running a recent enough Tor Browser Bundle”, “be sure to keep up-to-date in the future”, “consider disabling JavaScript”, “consider switching to a “live system” approach like Tails”, “be aware that many other vectors remain for vulnerabilities in Firefox”. It is strongly advised to read the advisory in full.</p>

<p>The versions of Firefox used in Pluggable Transport bundles are still vulnerable. Replacements have been built, with credit to David Fifield, but they are <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9391">yet to be released</a>.</p>

<p>The press is running many stories covering these events, several containing false information. A better example is <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/freedom-hosting/">Kevin Poulsen’s article</a> published in Wired on August, 5th. It did however assert “the malware only targets Firefox 17 ESR, the version of Firefox that forms the basis of the Tor Browser Bundle”, in-fact most recent Tor Browser Bundle releases, with the exception of Pluggable Transports bundles, contained the patched version of Firefox ESR.</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for July 2013</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of July has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000294.html">Philipp Winter</a> was first this time, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000295.html">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000296.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000299.html">Noel David Torress Taño</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000297.html">Colin C.</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000298.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000300.html">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000301.html">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000302.html">Mike Perry</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000303.html">George Kadianakis</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000304.html">Andrew Lewman</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Tails developers issued a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.20-rc1/">call for testing</a> of the first release candidate of the upcoming 0.20 [21]. Send them your reports!</p>

<p>Security researcher Jason Geffner presented a new tool to route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through the Tor network on Windows called <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-13/briefings.html#Geffner2">Tortilla</a> during Black Hat USA 2013 and subsequently on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029254.html">tor-talk mailing list</a>. Binary and source code are <a href="http://www.crowdstrike.com/community-tools/">available</a> and are awaiting reviews by the community.</p>

<p>Wendell <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029150.html">announced the first release of Tor.framework</a>, a “Cocoa framework that allows developers to write apps for Mac OS X and iOS that work over the Tor onion routing network”. No comments have been made yet. Feel free to look at the <a href="https://github.com/grabhive/Tor.framework">source code</a>, review and experiment.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029203.html">Jerzy Łogiewa asked on tor-talk</a> if Tor hidden services could be made to work near the speed of the standard web. Arian Sanusi replied that speed of light was actually the limiting factor for latency issues: “if relays were homogeneous distributed among the globe, two random relays will be 1/4 earth circumference apart on average. […] That’s 400ms from finite speed of light. Switches, routers and relays along the way will add to that.”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2013-August/060173.html">Michael Marz</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2013-August/060250.html">Neo</a> for running new mirrors of the Tor website.</p>

          <p><p>An attack that exploits a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-53.html">Firefox vulnerability in JavaScript</a> has been observed in the wild. Specifically, Windows users using the Tor Browser Bundle (which includes Firefox <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/">plus privacy patches</a>) appear to have been targeted.</p>

<p>This vulnerability was <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/08/04/investigating-security-vulnerability-report/">fixed in Firefox 17.0.7 ESR</a>. The following versions of the Tor Browser Bundle include this fixed version:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.3.25-10 (released <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages">June 26 2013</a>)</li>
<li>2.4.15-alpha-1 (released <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages">June 26 2013</a>)</li>
<li>2.4.15-beta-1 (released <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02415-rc-packages-available">July 8 2013</a>)</li>
<li>3.0alpha2 (released <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released">June 30 2013</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle users should ensure they&#39;re running a recent enough bundle version, and consider taking further security precautions.</p>
