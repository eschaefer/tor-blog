	      <p>Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.0, is out.</p>

<p>All users must <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/">upgrade</a> as soon as possible: this release fixes <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.23/">numerous security issues</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about what the 1.0 release means for Tails, and about its future, see the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.0/">full announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<p>Notable user-visible changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Security fixes

<ul>
<li>  Upgrade the web browser to 24.5.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox 24.5.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).</li>
<li>  Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1+tails1~d60.squeeze+1:

<ul>
<li>  Based on 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.</li>
<li>  Backport the fix for <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11464">bug #11464 on Tor Project&#39;s Trac</a>. It adds client-side blacklists for all Tor directory authority keys that was vulnerable to Heartbleed. This protects clients in case attackers were able to compromise a majority of the authority signing and identity keys.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Bugfixes

<ul>
<li>  Disable inbound I2P connections. Tails already restricts incoming connections, but this change tells I2P about it.</li>
<li>  Fix link to the system requirements documentation page in the Tails Upgrader error shown when too little RAM is available.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Minor improvements

<ul>
<li>  Upgrade I2P to 0.9.12-2~deb6u+1.</li>
<li>  Import TorBrowser profile. This was forgotten in Tails 0.23 and even though we didn&#39;t explicitly set those preferences in that release they defaulted to the same values. This future-proofs us in case the defaults would ever change.</li>
<li>  Import new custom version of Tor Launcher:

<ul>
<li>  Based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.3.</li>
<li>  Improve how Tor Launcher handles incomplete translation. (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11483">bug #11483 on Tor Project&#39;s Trac</a>; more future-proof fix for <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6885">ticket #6885</a>)</li>
<li>  Remove the bridge settings prompt. (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11482">bug #11482 on Tor Project&#39;s Trac</a>; closes <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6934">ticket #6934</a>)</li>
<li>  Always show bridge help button. (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11484">bug #11484 on Tor Project&#39;s Trac</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Integrate the new Tails logo into various places:

<ul>
<li>  The website</li>
<li>  The boot splash</li>
<li>  The &quot;About Tails&quot; dialog</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

	      <p>Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Cutting out relays running version 0.2.2.x</h1>

<p>Tor relays running the now ancient Tor 0.2.2.x are scheduled to be <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11149">removed from the consensus</a>. The change has already been merged in the master branch and will be out with the next Tor 0.2.5 alpha.</p>

<p>Even if most relay operators have been warned, the change has not yet been widely announced. But as three directory authorities are already not voting for the deprecated versions, the downtime of two others while cleaning up after the OpenSSL “Heartbleed” issue was sufficient to get these relays removed from the consensus <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=versions&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-23#versions">for a couple of days</a>, as Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004422.html">explained</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually relays running versions prior to 0.2.3.16-alpha might also be removed from the consensus. “I think 0.2.3.16-alpha’s fix of #6033 makes that one a plausible ’not below this one’ cutoff”, Roger writes in the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11149#comment:7">relevant Trac entry</a>.</p>

<p>Relay operators should always make sure to run a <a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/#recommendedversions">recommended Tor version</a>. The <a href="https://weather.torproject.org/subscribe/">Tor Weather service</a> can be used by relay operators to get email notifications if an outdated version is detected.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003436.html">announced</a> the third (and probably final) release candidate for Orbot 13.0.6: “The big improvements in this build are a fix for the disconnected UI/activity (Tor is on, but UI shows off), and improvements to the transparent proxying iptables scripts”.</p>

<p>The Tails developers put out two calls for testing: the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_1.0-rc1/index.en.html">first</a> is for the first release candidate of Tails 1.0; while the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_UEFI/index.en.html">second</a> is for UEFI support, which “allows you to start Tails using a USB stick on recent hardware, and especially on Mac”. “Test wildly”, and report any bugs you find!</p>

<p>Andrea Shepard <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004340.html">sent</a> a list of 1777 fingerprints for relays “which have ever turned up as potentially exposed by Heartbleed”. It appears that enough directory authority operators now <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004362.html">reject relays known to be problematic</a>: sssheep <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032762.html">reported</a> that the still-vulnerable section of the network was down to 0.01% of the consensus weight.</p>

<p>Mick <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004414.html">drew attention</a> to the fact that in its current state, <a href="https://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> — the command-line relay status monitor — wrongly advises relay operators to run it with the same user as Tor, in order to access information about the relay’s connections. This is in fact a very bad idea, and a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10702">ticket</a> is already open to address this issue. Lunar <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004412.html">detailed</a> the correct method of doing this, which is also explained in the ticket.</p>

<p>On the tor-relays mailing list, David Stainton <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004373.html">mentioned</a> his <a href="https://github.com/david415/ansible-tor">Tor role</a> for the <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible automation tool</a>. David hoped that “relay operators will find this useful for deploying and maintaining large numbers of Tor relays and bridges”. The documentation specifies that it currently works with Debian and Ubuntu systems, and contains several configuration examples.</p>

<p>David Fifield continued his progress on <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>, a pluggable transport “that routes your traffic through a third-party web service in a way that should be difficult to block”. David sent a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006718.html">call for wider testing</a> of experimental Tor Browser builds and a call for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006719.html">reviews of the code</a>. “There are a lot of components that make up the meek transport […] This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a new transport!”</p>

<p>Ximin Luo <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006689.html">raised</a> several points regarding how “indirect” pluggable transports like <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">flashproxy</a> or meek are currently handled by Tor. Whereas obfs3 or ScrambleSuit connect directly to the specified peer, transforming the data flow along the way, Ximin describes meek and flashproxy as providing “the metaphor of connecting to a global homogeneous service”. The latter being “incompatible with the metaphor of connecting to a specific endpoint”. Solutions on how to make the design, code, and configuration better are up for discussion.</p>

<p>Nicolas Vigier submitted his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000510.html">status report for March</a>.</p>

<p>Philipp Winter <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-papers-foci14-workshop">relayed</a> the call for papers for the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/call-for-papers">4th USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet</a>. The workshop will be held on August 18th, and should bring together the wider community of researchers and practitioners interested in Tor and other ways to study, detect, or circumvent censorship. Papers have to be submitted before May 13th.</p>

<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006723.html">wondered</a> whether anyone had “ever tried to start Tor from a Python application using Ctypes”, making it possible to “sandbox the Python application using AppArmor without enabling any kind of execve() call”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Many people email the Tor Help Desk from behind restrictive university firewalls that require them to connect using a proxy. Often these firewalls, Cyberoam and Fortiguard are two examples, use Deep Packet Inspection and block Tor traffic. Unfortunately Tor Browser users can’t use a proxy to connect to the internet and also use a pluggable transport. The Tor Browser team plans to include this capability in a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/8402">future release</a>.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>New beta version of Tor Browser 3.6</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-beta-2-released">second beta version of the next major Tor Browser release</a> is out. Version 3.6 main highlight is the seamless integration of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transports</a> in the browser.</p>

<p>The update is important to users already using version 3.6-beta1 as it contains an updated OpenSSL to address potential client-side vectors for <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a> (also known as “Heartbleed”).</p>

<p>The new beta also features “a Turkish language bundle, experimental Javascript hardening options, fixes for pluggable transport issues, and a fix for improper update notification while extracting the bundle over an already existing copy.”</p>

<p>Jump to the release announcement to know more. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-2/">update</a> and report any bug you may find.</p>

<h1>Key rotation at every level</h1>

<p>The “Heartbleed” issue forces system administrators to consider private keys of network-facing applications affected by the bug as compromised. As Tor has no shortage of private keys in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git">its design</a>, a serious number of new keys has to be generated.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004256.html">prompted</a> relay operators to get new identity keys, “especially from the big relays, and we’ll be happier tolerating a couple of bumpy days while the network recovers”. Switching to a new relay identity key means that the relay is <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay">seen as new</a> to the authorities again: they will lose their Guard status and bandwidth measurement. It seems that a number of operators followed the advice, as <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-15#bandwidth">the network lost around 1 Gbit/s of advertised capacity between April 7th and April 10th</a>.</p>

<p>For a brighter future if such massive RSA1024 relay key migration is ever again in order, Nick Mathewson wrote <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/230-rsa1024-relay-id-migration.txt">proposal 230</a>. The proposal describes a mechanism for relays to advertise their old identity to directory authorities and clients.</p>

<p>Directory authorities can currently tie a relay’s nickname to its identity key with the Named flag. That feature proved to be less helpful than it seemed, and can subject its users to impersonation attacks. As relays switch to new identity keys, those who keep the same name will lose their Named flag for the next six months. So now <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004254.html">seems</a> a good time to “throw out the Named and Unnamed flags entirely”. Sebastian Hahn acted on the idea and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006671.html">started a draft proposal</a>.</p>

<p>How should potentially compromised relays which have not switched to a new key be handled? On April 8th, grarpamp <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004259.html">observed</a> that more than 3000 relays had been restarted — hopefully to use the fixed version of OpenSSL. It is unknown how many of those relays have switched to a new key since. Andrea Shepard has been working on a <a href="http://charon.persephoneslair.org/%7Eandrea/private/tor-heartbleed-survey/">survey</a> to identify them. What is known though are relays that are unfortunately still vulnerable. Sina Rabbani has set up a <a href="https://encrypted.redteam.net/bleeding_edges/">visible list for guards and exits</a>. To protect Tor users, directory authority operators have started to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004336.html">reject descriptors for vulnerable relays</a>.</p>

<p>The identity keys for directory authorities are kept offline. But they are used to certify medium-term signing keys. Roger Dingledine’s<br>
 <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006663.html">analysis</a> reports “two (moria1 and urras) of the directory authorities were unaffected by the openssl bug, and seven were affected”.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, five of the seven affected authorities had new signing keys. In the meantime, Nick and Andrea have been busy writing code to <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11464">prevent the old keys from being accepted by Tor clients</a>.</p>

<p>Changing the relay identity keys of the directory authorities has not been done so far “because current clients expect them to be at their current IP:port:fingerprint and would scream in their logs and refuse to connect if the relay identity key changes”. The specification of the missing piece of code to allow a smoother transition has been written by Nick Mathewson in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/231-migrate-authority-rsa1024-ids.txt">proposal 231</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/freenodestaff/status/455425032203022337">hidden service operators are also generating new keys</a>. Unfortunately, this forces every user of the service to update the address in their bookmarks or configuration.</p>

<p>As Roger summarized it: “fun times”.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for March 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of March continued, with submissions from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000505.html">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000507.html">Roger Dingledine</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000508.html">Kelley Misata</a>.</p>

<p>Roger also sent out the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000506.html">report for SponsorF</a>, and the Tails team reported on <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_03/">its progress</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>CVE-2014-0160 prompted Anthony Basile to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032642.html">release version 20140409</a> of Tor-ramdisk. OpenSSL has been updated and so has the kernel. Upgrading is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-April/000390.html">released new browser bundles configured to use the meek</a> transport automatically. These bundles “use a web browser extension to make the HTTPS requests, so that the TLS layer looks like Firefox” — <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006662.html">because it is Firefox</a>. Meek is a promising censorship circumvention solution, so please try them!</p>

<p>The Tails developers <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/and_the_winner_is/">announced</a> that Tchou’s proposal is the winner of the recent Tails logo contest: “in the coming days we will keep on fine-tuning it and integrating it in time for Tails 1.0. So don’t hesitate to comment on it.”</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000504.html">reported on his week in Stockholm</a> for the <a href="https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/">Civil Rights Defender’s</a> Defender’s Days where he trained activists and “learned more about the situation in Moldova, Transnistria, Burma, Vietnam, and Bahrain”.</p>

<p>Andrew also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000534.html">updated the instructions for mirror operators</a> wishing to have their sites listed on the Tor Project website. Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000536.html">Andreas Reich</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000537.html">Sebastian M. Bobrecki</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000541.html">Jeremy L. Gaddis </a> for running new mirrors!</p>

<p>Arlo Breault <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006661.html">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://github.com/arlolra/bulb">Bulb</a>, a Tor relay web status dashboard. “There’s not much to it yet, but I thought I’d share […] Contributions welcome!”</p>

<p>Alan Shreve <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006657.html">requested</a> feedback on “Shroud”, a proposal for “a new system to provide public hidden services […] whose network location cannot be determined (like Tor hidden services) but are accessible by any client on the internet”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users often ask for steps they can take to maximize their anonymity while using Tor. Tips for staying anonymous when using Tor are visible on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">download page</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Jack Gundo uses Windows 7 with the built-in firewall and wants to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1882/88">block all traffic except Tor traffic</a>. Guest suggested that on a closed-source system one can never be sure that all traffic really is blocked, so the original poster might be better off using a router which does the job. Another possible solution is PeerBlock, which also allows you to block all traffic from a machine.</p>

<p>Broot uses obfs3 to route OpenVPN traffic and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/693/88">can’t get obfsproxy running</a> because the latest version only implements SOCKS4. Yawning Angel answered that version 0.2.7 of obfsproxy uses SOCKS5 and works with OpenVPN. However there is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006427.html">a bug that needs to be worked around</a>.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>The Tor Browser Team is proud to announce the second beta in the 3.6 series. Packages are available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-beta">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-2/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release is an important security update over 3.6-beta-1. This release updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g, to address potential client-side vectors for <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a>.</p>

<p>The browser itself does not use OpenSSL, and is not vulnerable to this CVE. However, this release is still considered an important security update, because it is theoretically possible to extract sensitive information from the Tor client sub-process.</p>

<p>This beta also features a Turkish language bundle, experimental Javascript hardening options, fixes for pluggable transport issues, and a fix for improper update notification while extracting the bundle over an already existing copy.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog since 3.6-beta-1:</p>
