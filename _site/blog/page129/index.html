          <p>Tor 0.2.1.7-alpha fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu
packages (and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes
a smaller security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local
services, adds better defense against DNS poisoning attacks on exit
relays, further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety
of other issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.7-alpha - 2008-11-08</p>

<p><strong>Security fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being
consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its
exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address
the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s
an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.</li>
<li>The &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; config options did not clear the
supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The &quot;User&quot; option
is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified
user&#39;s primary group. The &quot;Group&quot; option is now ignored. For more
detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL
in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum
and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848.</li>
<li>Do not use or believe expired v3 authority certificates. Patch
from Karsten. Bugfix in 0.2.0.x. Fixes bug 851.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Now NodeFamily and MyFamily config options allow spaces in
identity fingerprints, so it&#39;s easier to paste them in.
Suggested by Lucky Green.</li>
<li>Implement the 0x20 hack to better resist DNS poisoning: set the
case on outgoing DNS requests randomly, and reject responses that do
not match the case correctly. This logic can be disabled with the
ServerDNSRamdomizeCase setting, if you are using one of the 0.3%
of servers that do not reliably preserve case in replies. See
&quot;Increased DNS Forgery Resistance through 0x20-Bit Encoding&quot;
for more info.</li>
<li>Preserve case in replies to DNSPort requests in order to support
the 0x20 hack for resisting DNS poisoning attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hidden service performance improvements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When the client launches an introduction circuit, retry with a
new circuit after 30 seconds rather than 60 seconds.</li>
<li>Launch a second client-side introduction circuit in parallel
after a delay of 15 seconds (based on work by Christian Wilms).</li>
<li>Hidden services start out building five intro circuits rather
than three, and when the first three finish they publish a service
descriptor using those. Now we publish our service descriptor much
faster after restart.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minor fix in the warning messages when you&#39;re having problems
bootstrapping; also, be more forgiving of bootstrap problems when
we&#39;re still making incremental progress on a given bootstrap phase.</li>
<li>When we&#39;re choosing an exit node for a circuit, and we have
no pending streams, choose a good general exit rather than one that
supports &quot;all the pending streams&quot;. Bugfix on 0.1.1.x. Fix by rovv.</li>
<li>Send a valid END cell back when a client tries to connect to a
nonexistent hidden service port. Bugfix on 0.1.2.15. Fixes bug

<ol>
<li>Patch from rovv.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If a broken client asks a non-exit router to connect somewhere,
do not even do the DNS lookup before rejecting the connection.
Fixes another case of bug 619. Patch from rovv.</li>
<li>Fix another case of assuming, when a specific exit is requested,
that we know more than the user about what hosts it allows.
Fixes another case of bug 752. Patch from rovv.</li>
<li>Check which hops rendezvous stream cells are associated with to
prevent possible guess-the-streamid injection attacks from
intermediate hops. Fixes another case of bug 446. Based on patch
from rovv.</li>
<li>Avoid using a negative right-shift when comparing 32-bit
addresses. Possible fix for bug 845 and bug 811.</li>
<li>Make the assert_circuit_ok() function work correctly on circuits that
have already been marked for close.</li>
<li>Fix read-off-the-end-of-string error in unit tests when decoding
introduction points.</li>
<li>Fix uninitialized size field for memory area allocation: may improve
memory performance during directory parsing.</li>
<li>Treat duplicate certificate fetches as failures, so that we do
not try to re-fetch an expired certificate over and over and over.</li>
<li>Do not say we&#39;re fetching a certificate when we&#39;ll in fact skip it
because of a pending download.</li>
</ul>

          <p>The official version of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html.en#TypicalAbuses">&quot;What to expect&quot;</a> when running a Tor exit relay is fairly brief. This post will be verbose.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been running a node since 2003. I first started off running a node in Xen on a server at a colocation datacenter with an un-metered line. The dual Xeon kept up with the demands fairly well. I ran it with the default exit policy with open irc ports. Things went smoothly for many months until my ISP called. The Abuse Department said my IP was reported in a mass irc bot attack against <a href="http://www.dal.net/">DalNet</a>. I spent some time on the phone explaining Tor, explaining how it&#39;s an anonymizing proxy, and how it&#39;s used for good in the world. I highlighted that of the megabits of bandwidth it provided 7x24 for many months, this was the first issue. They asked that I block irc ports, and all would be well. I modified the exit policy to block irc ports.</p>

<p>Many more months passed without issue. Apparently, given the lax bandwidth controls, many other customers ran Tor exit nodes as well. The ISP updated their Terms of Service, and notified all of us that running any proxy was now in violation of the ToS. This meant I was at risk of disconnection. I switched to a non-exit configuration. I ran this way for months. I knew full well I was violating the ToS. If I was disconnected, it was my fault. Then the ISP was bought; and the new owners demanded I shut off my Tor node or be disconnected. It was fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>Welcome to 2005. New ISP, same nickname, different server, same non-exit Tor configuration. Tor loved the dual opteron cpus. The difference in cpu load was dramatic. The load before was 40-50% cpu for &quot;NumCPU 2&quot; on the dual Xeons. On the dual Opterons, the load was 5-10%. Same non-exit config. Same version of Tor. Different hardware, newer version of the OS (Redhat 4 as opposed to CentOS 3).</p>

<p>I sustained 15 Mb/s the first day. Woo! Oh wait, they meter bandwidth at the switch, and now I have to pay for it. Ok, BandwidthRate here we come. The new ISP was relatively new. The CEO was on the forums. That&#39;s how small and new they were. We chatted, he didn&#39;t see a problem with Tor. Great.</p>

<p>I changed the config to the default exit policy with irc blocked. About a month later, the DMCA Notice bots hit. And boy, they hit like hourly. I setup a procmail recipe to pull the company and supposed infringing content out of their emails and stuff them into a response template based on <a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-dmca-response.html">The Tor DMCA Response</a> Template. After about 3 weeks of this, I switched back to non-exit mode for a month or so. No one asked me to do this, I just felt nervous; or perhaps it was the chilling effect of the notices. And then I switched back to default minus irc exit configuration.</p>

<p>Months would go by without a complaint. Google would occasionally complain that my IP defaced some Google Groups. Or some random person from a blog that got hit with spam from my IP would complain. Once again, I&#39;d explain Tor, and everything would resolve itself. I wrote <a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorAbuseTemplates">this wiki entry</a> after noting the common patterns that worked when dealing with abuse complaints.</p>

<p>Recently, the DMCA notices have become popular again. However, this time they&#39;re complaining directly to the ISP, not to me. My ISP opens support tickets and copy and pastes the exact email they received. I respond with the same DMCA Response template I did before. So far, they just keep closing the tickets.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, Tor is pretty benign. I fluctuate between 2-5 Mb/s depending upon how much transit I&#39;ve consumed for that billing period. Tor&#39;s bandwidth controls are surprisingly accurate. When I configure Tor to consume 1.8TB of transit over 30 days, it&#39;ll do it and not a byte more.</p>

<p>In total, I&#39;ve received around 50 DMCA infringement notices, 20 abuse complaints, and zero visits from the Feds. After 5 years, I must have transferred petabytes of normal Tor traffic. Hopefully, I&#39;ve helped users in restrictive environments see the unfiltered Internet. Or helped people keep their privacy and anonymity intact while online. Sorry to disappoint you if you were expecting SWAT teams and black helicopters and mad car chases through the streets. Real life is much more boring.</p>

          <p>We&#39;ve <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor,-germany,-and-data-retention">already asked</a> about how to handle the forthcoming data retention directive in Germany.</p>

<p>A few more governments are either heading down that path, or already there:</p>

<p>I suspect we&#39;ll see proposals for this in the USA soon enough.</p>

          <p>A few people have told me about <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/will-the-internet-always-be-anonymous--482519">this TechRadar</a> story. The implication is that the US Air Force is going to <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?print_preview=1&amp;s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=e72854d6e3c1a044038563ef1e0fdfa6&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;cck=1&amp;au=&amp;ck=">do away</a> with the anonymity of the Internet. In reality, I think these people are looking for Tor&#39;s opinion on this sort of &quot;news&quot;. Rather than pick apart the silliness of the statements, a few things bothered me about the TechRadar article; which I&#39;ve already heard many times.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s tackle the misnomer that the Internet is inherently anonymous. This quote states the &quot;common wisdom&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s true that the TCP/IP protocol, as currently implemented, makes it very hard to verify the source of any given network packet, but that&#39;s purely because the network architects chose to make it that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, IP addresses are designed and used for routing. It&#39;s easy to figure out where traffic originates if you have the IP address. What&#39;s not so easy is figuring out if the owner of the system at that IP address was the actual sender of the traffic. There&#39;s a popular notion that you are your IP address; and that actions taken with your IP can be tied back to you. IP addresses are for routing, not authentication. The Air Force plan wants to solve the latter problem of authentication (Network friend or foe). A subpoena or legal demand of a provider (blog, forum, ISP, etc) can reveal the IP address and possibly its owner.</p>

<p>The larger concern with the article is that it states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it&#39;s also what lets protesters protest and dissidents diss, so there are some genuinely valid reasons for wanting to preserve internet privacy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then ends with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous internets will always exist - the terrorists, the paedophiles and the tin-foil-hat brigade will make sure of that. But in 10 years time, the idea of the mainstream internet - the one that all of us use every day - being anonymous, will seem as quaint as a street without CCTV cameras.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anonymity is a defense against the tyranny of the majority. There are <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torusers">many, many valid uses</a> of anonymity tools, such as Tor. The belief that anonymous tools exist only for the edges of societies is narrow-minded. The tools exist and are used by all. Much like the Internet, the tools can be used for good or bad. The negative uses of such tools typically generate huge headlines, but not the positive uses. Raising the profile of the positive uses of anonymity tools, such as Tor, is one of our challenges.</p>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>A few weeks ago, I watched some non-technical OS X users attempt to install the Vidalia-Tor Bundle. Many of them tried to drag the installation package to Applications. A few were surprised it required an installation at all.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/pkg/osx">Vidalia trunk</a> I committed a different way to install Vidalia, Tor, and Polipo. In this new dmg, you just open it up and drag the Vidalia icon into Applications. You now have Tor, Vidalia, and Polipo pre-configured and running completely out of Applications. While this works well for users that never installed Tor/Vidalia before, it doesn&#39;t work so well for existing installations.</p>

<p>Is it smart to think users will un-install their existing Vidalia/Tor bundle before using the drag and drop installation method? My inclination is that it isn&#39;t smart. This installation method also removes the ability to automatically install Torbutton for Firefox.</p>

<p>In comparison, the current method is to ship a dmg which contains a metapackage. This metapackage contains a few scripts to run pre and post-installation, which do smart things to save current configurations, upgrade existing software binaries, and try to install Torbutton for Firefox. In general, this method has worked well for most users. I&#39;ve heard from enough people to know they tried to drag and drop the metapackage into Applications at first, and when that didn&#39;t work, double-clicked the metapackage to start the installer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now leaning towards creating a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/">Tor Browser Bundle</a> for OS X; which can run out of the dmg or be installed via drag and drop. Much like the current Tor Browser Bundle (also, we should stop naming everything Tor), it would be self-contained and leave zero trace on the machine after closing.</p>

<p>Thoughts on ways to make the OS X install easier, ostensibly via drag and drop install? Or is the effort to create a TBB for OS X a better use of resources?</p>
