	      <p>The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) was an excellent opportunity to improve on the Ahmia search engine. With Google&#39;s stipend and friendly mentoring from The Tor Project, I was able to concentrate on development of my search engine project. Thank you all!</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/gsoc">GSoC 2014</a> is over, but I am sticking around to continue developing and maintaining Ahmia.</p>

<p>Here is the current status of ahmia after GSoC development:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ahmia is <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/">open-source search engine software</a> for Tor hidden service websites. You can test the running search engine at <a href="https://ahmia.fi/search/">ahmia.fi</a>.</p>

<p>Building a search engine for anonymous web sites running inside the Tor network is an interesting problem. Tor enables web servers to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services">hide their location</a> and Tor users can connect to these authenticated hidden services while the server and the user both stay anonymous. However, finding web content is hard without a good search engine and therefore a search engine is needed for the Tor network.</p>

<p>Web search engines are needed to navigate and search the web. There were no search engines for searching hidden service web content, so I decided to build a search engine specially for Tor. I registered ahmia.fi and started development on it as a side project in 2010.</p>

<p>This development involved programming and testing web crawlers, thinking of ways to find hidden service addresses (since the protocol does not allow enumeration), learning about the Tor community, and implementing a filtering policy. Moreover, I implemented <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/">an API</a> that empowers other Tor services that publish content to integrate with Ahmia.</p>

<p>As a result, Ahmia is a working search engine that indexes, searches and catalogs content published on Tor Hidden Services. Furthermore, it is an environment to share meaningful statistics, insights and news about the Tor network itself.</p>

<h2>Interesting Summer of Code</h2>

<p>One of my best memories from the summer is the Tor Project&#39;s Summer 2014 Developers meeting that was hosted by Mozilla in Paris, France. I have always admired the people who are working on the Tor Project.</p>

<p>I also loved the coding itself. Finally I had time to improve the Ahmia search engine and its many features. <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/commits/master">I did a lot of work</a> and liked it.</p>

<p>Some journalist were very interested in my work: Carola Frediani asked if I could analyze the content of hidden services. I coded a script that fetches every front page&#39;s HTML, I gathered all the keywords, headers and description texts and made a simple word cloud visualization.</p>

<p><img src="https://ahmia.fi/static/visuals/content.png" alt="Hidden website content visualization."></p>

<p>It is a simple way to glance what is published on the hidden websites.</p>

<p>Carola found this data useful and used it in her presentation at <a href="http://www.sotn.it" title="www.sotn.it">www.sotn.it</a> on June 11th.</p>

<h2>Technical design of ahmia</h2>

<p>The Ahmia web service is written using the Django web framework. As a result, the server-side language is Python. On the client-side, most of the pages are plain HTML. There are some pages that require JavaScript, but the search itself works without client-side JavaScript.</p>

<p>The components of Ahmia are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Django front-end site</li>
<li>PostgreSQL database for the site</li>
<li>Custom scripts to download data about hidden services</li>
<li>Django-Haystack connection to Solr database</li>
<li>Apache Solr for the crawled data</li>
<li>OnionBot crawler that gathers data to Solr database</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/master/technical_architecture.png" alt="Technical architecture."></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/README.md">See installation and developing tutorial</a></p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>The full-text search is implemented using Django-Haystack. The search is using crawled website data that is saved to Apache Solr.</p>

<h2>OnionDir</h2>

<p><a href="https://ahmia.fi/address/">OnionDir</a> is a list of known online hidden service addresses. A separate script gathers this list and fetches information fields from the HTML (title, keywords, description etc.). Furthermore, users can freely edit these fields.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also started a convention where hidden service admins can add a file to their website, called <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/descriptionProposal/">description.json</a>, to offer an official description of their site in Ahmia.</p>

<p>As a result, this information is shown in <a href="https://ahmia.fi/address/#/search=Description%20downloaded%20directly%20from%20the%20hidden%20service.">the OnionDir page</a> and over 80 domains are already using this method.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>We are gathering statistics from hidden services. As a result, we can represent and share <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/">meaningful data about hidden services</a> and <a href="https://ahmia.fi/stats/viewer">visualize it</a>.</p>

<p>We are gathering three types of popularity data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tor2web nodes share their visiting statistics to Ahmia</li>
<li>Number of public WWW backlinks to hidden services</li>
<li>Number of clicks in the search results</li>
</ol>

<p>The click counter tells the total number of clicks on a search result in ahmia.fi</p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>

<p>We have decided to filter any sites related to child porn from our search results. Ahmia is removing everything related to these websites. These websites may not be actual child porn sites. They are rather sites where users can post content (forums, file and image uploads etc.) and as the result there have been, momentarily at least, some suspicious content that has not been moderated in a reasonable period of time. Ahmia.fi does not have the time to monitor these sites carefully and we are banning sites from our public index if we see any evidence of child abuse. Of course, the ban is removed if the site itself contacts us and we review the website to be OK.</p>

<p>In practice, Ahmia calculates the MD5 sums of the banned domains for use as a filtering policy. Moreover, we are sharing this list and Tor2web nodes can use the list to filter out pages.</p>

<p>At the moment, there seems to be 1228 hidden website domains online and 7 of them has been filtered because they are possibly sharing child porn content.</p>

<h2>OnionBot</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/onionbot">OnionBot</a> is a crawler for hidden service websites based on the Scrapy framework. It crawls the Tor network and passes data to the search database. OnionBot requires the Tor software (using Tor2web mode) and Polipo. The results are saved to Apache Solr.</p>

<h2>Apache Solr</h2>

<p>Apache Solr is a popular, open source enterprise search platform. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, and near real-time indexing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/solr/schema.xml">schema.xml</a> file contains all of the details about which fields your documents can contain, and how those fields should be dealt with when adding documents to the index, or when querying those fields.</p>

<h2>Security measures for privacy</h2>

<p>In the software</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not log any IP addresses, see <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/apache2">Apache configuration</a></li>
<li>We are gathering real-time clicks, however, this data is not shown accurately</li>
</ul>

<p>In the host ahmia.fi</p>

<ul>
<li>Backend servers are run separately and they do not have any knowledge about the end-users</li>
<li>All servers are hosted in countries with strong privacy laws. For example, Finland and the Netherlands</li>
<li>Communication between servers is encrypted</li>
<li>Only a few trustworthy people know the locations of the back-end servers and are able to access them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>GSoC 2014 was fun and productive!</p>

<p>There is a lot more to do. However, I do not have time to do everything myself. Of course, I am coding when I have time and maintaining the search engine.</p>

<p>In addition, I am going to write a scientific article about the implementation.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who would be interested in developing Ahmia.fi?</p>

<p>Is anyone familiar with Solr and would know how to tweak it for full text search?</p>

<p>Furthermore, any kind of help would be most welcome. There are always Linux admin duties, HTML/CSS design, bug fixing, Django development, etc...</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.5 and 4.0-alpha-2 are out</h1>

<p>The Tor Browser team put out two new releases of the privacy-preserving web browser. Among the major changes, version 3.6.5 upgrades Firefox to 24.8.0esr, and includes an improved prompt to help users defend against <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/033969.html">HTML5 canvas image fingerprinting</a>, following a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12684">patch</a> by Isis Lovecruft. Version 4.0-alpha-2 additionally includes the code for the forthcoming Tor Browser auto-updater (switched off by default) and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-September/000458.html">“better hardening for Windows and Linux builds”</a>.</p>

<p>As ever, you can download the new releases along with their signature files from the Tor Project’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">distribution directory</a>. Please upgrade as soon as you can.</p>

<h1>Tails 1.1.1 is out</h1>

<p>The Tails team <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1.1/">released</a> version 1.1.1 of the Debian- and Tor-based live operating system. As well as upgrading key components like Tor, Iceweasel, and Linux, this release disables I2P by default when Tails is booted, in response to the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13/">vulnerability recently disclosed by Exodus Intelligence</a>. Like Truecrypt, “i2p” must now be specified as a parameter on booting by users who wish to use it.</p>

<p>A number of other security fixes and routine improvements make this an important update for all Tails users. See the full changelog in the team’s announcement, then update from a running copy of Tails 1.1 if you have one, or head to the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/">download page</a> if you don’t.</p>

<h1>Helping Internet services accept anonymous users</h1>

<p>Without a large and diverse network, run by thousands of dedicated volunteers, Tor would be nowhere near as useful or popular as it currently is. Although the current situation might at times seem fragile, there are still many places where it is feasible to host Tor exit nodes.</p>

<p>However, Tor would become much less attractive to users if they found themselves unable to reach or interact with their favorite websites while using it, a situation that is unfortunately growing more common as site administrators and engineers react negatively to instances of abusive Tor traffic by banning anonymous connections outright. Tor users and developers, as well as members of other online communities (such as <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Partnership_between_Wikimedia_community_and_Tor_community">Wikimedia</a>), have tried to address the issue before, but real progress has yet to be made.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine wrote a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users">“call to arms”</a> explaining the problem in detail and exploring possible paths to a solution: “Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections […]. Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help”.</p>

<p>Since the problem involves humans as much as it does machines, anyone working on it will have to be both “technical” but also ”good at activism”. If you fit that description, OTF has expressed interest in funding work on this issue through their <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a>. Please read Roger’s blog post in full for more details.</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for August 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000626.html">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000627.html">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000628.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000629.html">Noel Torres</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000630.html">Kevin P Dyer</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000633.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000635.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000636.html">Arthur D.

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000653.html">P D</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000673.html">Daniel Pajonzeck</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website and software!</p>

<p>Also on the subject of mirrors, Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000675.html">alerted</a> the tor-mirrors mailing list to the fact that the Tor Project website (specifically the distribution directory) will shortly be increasing in size to eight or nine gigabytes, as a result of the soon-to-be-implemented <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/4234">Tor Browser updater</a>. Mirror operators will need to ensure that they can provide enough disk space to accommodate the change.</p>

<p>whonixqubes <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-August/034562.html">announced</a> the release of an integrated version of the Whonix and Qubes operating systems: “I look forward to helping make Qubes + Whonix integration even tighter and more seamless throughout the future.”</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>The help desk has been asked if Tor can make a website visit appear to come from China. Tor connections appear to originate from the country where the exit relay in use is located; since Tor is blocked in China, there are zero exit relays in China. A visualization of the different country-locations of exit relays can be found on Tor’s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html#country-exits-only">metrics page</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Anony Mouse wanted to know why Facebook shows the location of the user’s last login over Tor as <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3364/88">Baghdad or Dhaka</a>, instead of the real location of the exit relay. qbi posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/qbi/status/506550322308055040">screenshot</a> showing this issue. According to Facebook, this information is based on an approximation, but this approximation locates all Tor exit relays either in Baghdad or in Dhaka.</p>

<p>user3500 <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3961/88">wants to contribute to Tor</a> and asks how this can be done as an inexperienced developer. Jens Kubieziel replied with several possibilities, including reading the volunteer page and Tor Weekly News: in particular, the section containing easy development tasks might be a good start. Roya pointed out that any contribution is better than no contribution, and encouraged user3500 to just get started. Umut Seven recommended writing unit tests.</p>

<p>Kras wants to use FoxyProxy in connection with Tor Browser Bundle and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3239/88">asks if it is safe to do so</a>. At the moment, there is only an answer saying “yes”, without any explanation. What is your experience? Is it safe for a user to install and use FoxyProxy?</p>

	      <h1>Tor Browser 3.6.5</h1>

<p>The fifth pointfix release of the 3.6 series is available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6.5/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release features <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.8">important security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>

<p>This release also features improvements to the canvas image extraction permissions prompt, and will now log offending script urls to the browser console. It also restores the missing RELRO hardening option to the Linux bundles, and disables NTLM and Negotiate HTTP auth (which can leak sensitive information about the computer). To avoid resolution fingerprinting, popups are also opened in new tabs by default.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog for 3.6.5:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All Platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr</li>
<li>Update NoScript to 2.6.8.39</li>
<li>Update HTTPS Everywhere to 4.0.0</li>
<li>Update Torbutton to 1.6.12.1</li>
<li>Bug 12684: New strings for canvas image extraction message</li>
<li>Bug 8940: Move RecommendedTBBVersions file to <a href="http://www.torproject.org" title="www.torproject.org">www.torproject.org</a></li>
<li>Bug 9531: Workaround to avoid rare hangs during New Identity </li>
<li>Bug 12684: Improve Canvas image extraction permissions prompt</li>

<ul>
<li>Bug 12103: Adding RELRO hardening back to browser binaries. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Tor Browser 4.0-alpha-2</h1>

<p>In addition, we are also releasing the second alpha in the 4.0 series, available for download on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha">extended downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>This release also includes <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.8">important security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>

<p>In addition to including the changes in 3.6.5, this release also is the first Tor Browser release to enable the in-browser Firefox-based updater. This means that if all goes well, 4.0-alpha-2 users will notified of an available update via a notification similar to that in Firefox. You will then be able to download and install it directly via the browser UI. By default, neither the download nor the update will happen automatically, so if you are not feeling adventurous, you need not allow it to update in this way. Even if you are feeling adventurous, you should probably back up your Tor Browser directory before updating.</p>

<p>In addition to the updater, this release should also re-enable the basic hardening features on Windows, including ASLR, DEP, and SSP.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the NoScript behavior in this release has changed. Selecting &quot;Temporarily allow scripts&quot; will now automatically allow all scripts in a page. This was done for usability reasons, to make it easier for novice users to run Tor Browser with scripting disabled most of the time. This will also hopefully make it possible for more people to use the &quot;High Security&quot; setting in our upcoming <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387">Security Slider</a>, which will have Javascript disabled globally via NoScript by default.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog for 4.0-alpha-2:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All Platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr</li>

<li>Bug 11405: Remove firewall prompt from wizard.</li>

<li>Bug 12444: Provide feedback when “Copy Tor Log” is clicked.</li>
<li>Bug 11199: Improve error messages if Tor exits unexpectedly </li>
<li>Update Torbutton to 1.6.12.1</li>
<li>Bug 12684: New strings for canvas image extraction message</li>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Looking for a way to help the Internet stay open and free? This topic needs some dedicated people to give it more attention — it could easily grow to as large a project as Tor itself. In the short term, OTF&#39;s <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a> has expressed interest in funding somebody to get this project going, and EFF&#39;s Eva Galperin has said she&#39;d be happy to manage the person as an OTF fellow at EFF, with mentorship from Tor people. The first round of those proposals has a deadline in a few days, but if that timeframe doesn&#39;t work for you, this problem isn&#39;t going away: let us know and we can work with you to help you coordinate other funding.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>We used to think there are two main ways that the Tor network can fail. First, legal or policy pressure can make it so nobody is willing to run a relay. Second, pressure on or from Internet Service Providers can reduce the number of places willing to host exit relays, which in turn squeezes down the anonymity that the network can provide. Both of these threats are hard to solve, but they are challenges that we&#39;ve known about for a decade, and due in large part to strong ongoing collaborations we have a pretty good handle on them.</p>

<p>We missed a third threat to Tor&#39;s success: a growing number of websites treat users from anonymity services differently. Slashdot doesn&#39;t let you post comments over Tor, Wikipedia won&#39;t let you edit over Tor, and Google sometimes gives you a captcha when you try to search (depending on what other activity they&#39;ve seen from that exit relay lately). Some sites like Yelp go further and refuse to even serve pages to Tor users.</p>

<p>The result is that the Internet as we know it is siloing. Each website operator works by itself to figure out how to handle anonymous users, and generally neither side is happy with the solution. The problem isn&#39;t limited to just Tor users, since these websites face basically the same issue with users from open proxies, users from AOL, users from Africa, etc.</p>

<p>Two recent trends make the problem more urgent. First, sites like Cloudflare, Akamai, and Disqus create bottlenecks where their components are used by many websites. This centralization impacts many websites at once when e.g. Cloudflare changes its strategy for how to handle Tor users. Second, services increasingly outsource their blacklisting, such that e.g. Skype refuses connections from IP addresses that run Tor exit relays, not because they worry about abuse via Tor (it&#39;s hard to use Skype over Tor), but because their blacklist provider has an incentive to be overbroad in its blocking. (Blacklist providers compete in part by having &quot;the most complete&quot; list, and in many cases it&#39;s hard for services to notice that they&#39;re losing contributions from now-missing users.)</p>

<p>Technical mechanisms do exist to let anonymous users interact with websites in ways that control abuse better. Simple technical approaches include &quot;you can read but you can&#39;t post&quot; or &quot;you have to log in to post&quot;. More complex approaches track reputation of users and give them access to site features based on past behavior of the user rather than on past behavior of their network address. Several research designs suggest using <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing">anonymous credentials</a>, where users anonymously receive a cryptographic credential and then prove to the website that they possess a credential that hasn&#39;t been blacklisted — without revealing their credential, so the website can&#39;t link them to their past behavior.</p>

<p>Social mechanisms have also proven effective in some cases, ranging from community moderation (I hear Wikipedia Germany manually approves edits from users who don&#39;t have sufficiently reputable accounts), to flagging behavior from Tor users (even though you don&#39;t know *which* Tor user it is) so other participants can choose how to interact with them.</p>

<p>But applying these approaches to real-world websites has not gone well overall. Part of the challenge is that the success stories are not well-publicized, so each website feels like it&#39;s dealing with the question in isolation. Some sites do in fact face quite different problems, which require different solutions: Wikipedia doesn&#39;t want jerks to change the content of pages, whereas Yelp doesn&#39;t want competitors to scrape all its pages. We can also imagine that some companies, like ones that get their revenue from targeted advertising, are fundamentally uninterested in allowing anonymous users at all.</p>

<h2>A way forward</h2>

<p>The solution I envision is to get a person who is both technical and good at activism to focus on this topic. Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections, and look for patterns that help us identify the common (centralized) services that impact many sites. At the same time, we should make a list of solutions — technical and social — that are in use today. There are a few community-led starts on the Tor wiki already, like <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/projects/DontBlockMe">the DontBlockMe page</a> and a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor">List of Services Blocking Tor</a>.</p>

<p>Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help. Armed with the toolkit of options we found in step one, we should go to the first (most promising) site on the list and work with them to understand their problem. Ideally we can adapt one of the ideas from the toolkit; otherwise we&#39;ll need to invent and develop a new approach tailored to their situation and needs. Then we should go to the second site on the list with our (now bigger) toolkit, and so on down the list. Once we have some success stories, we can consider how to scale better, such as holding a conference where we invite the five best success cases plus the next five unsolved sites on our list.</p>

<p>A lot of the work will be building and maintaining social connections with engineers at the services, to help them understand what&#39;s possible and to track regressions (for example, every year or so Google gets a new engineer in charge of deciding when to give out Captchas, and they seem to have no institutional memory of how the previous one decided to handle Tor users). It might be that the centralization of Cloudflare et al can be turned around into an advantage, where making sure they have a good practices will scale to help many websites at once.</p>

<p>EFF is the perfect organization to lead this charge, given its community connections, its campaigns like <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014">Who has your back?</a>, and its more (at least more than Tor ;) neutral perspective on the topic. And now, when everybody is sympathetic about the topic of surveillance, is a great time to try to take back some ground. We have a wide variety of people who want to help, from scientists and research groups who would help with technical solutions if only they understood the real problems these sites face, to users and activists who can help publicize both the successful cases and the not-yet-successful cases.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to the future, I&#39;m also part of an upcoming research collaboration with Dan Boneh, Andrea Forte, Rachel Greenstadt, Ryan Henry, Benjamin Mako Hill, and Dan Wallach who will look both at the technical side of the problem (building more useful ideas for the toolkit) and also the social side of the problem: how can we quantify the loss to Wikipedia, and to society at large, from turning away anonymous contributors? Wikipedians say &quot;we have to blacklist all these IP addresses because of trolls&quot; and &quot;Wikipedia is rotting because nobody wants to edit it anymore&quot; in the same breath, and we believe these points are related. The group is at the &quot;applying for an NSF grant&quot; stage currently, so it will be a year or more before funding appears, but I mention it because we should get somebody to get the ball rolling now, and hopefully we can expect reinforcements to appear as momentum builds.</p>

<p>In summary, if this call to arms catches your eye, your next steps are to think about what you most want to work on to get started, and how you would go about doing it. You can apply for an OTF fellowship, or we can probably help you find other funding sources as needed too.</p>
