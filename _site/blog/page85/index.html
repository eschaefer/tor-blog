<p><strong>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Held a successful public hackfest at MIT&#39;s Center for Future Civic
Media,

15th.</li>
<li>Due to the events in Egypt, Tor usage by activists, and human rights
organizations requesting our technical help, we were featured in over 30 news
stories, interviews, and articles. The master list of the media highlights is at
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Karsten did some work to publish sanitized bridge pool assignments. We&#39;re
going to publish the information which distribution pool a bridge is assigned
to. The distribution pool defines whether we&#39;re giving out bridges via HTTP,
via email, or not at all (reserved pool). The plan is to remove all sensitive
information from bridge pool assignments before making them available on
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html" title="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html">https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html</a>. The discussion was started on
the or-dev list
at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We released an updated version of Tor
Weather, <a href="https://weather.torproject.org" title="https://weather.torproject.org">https://weather.torproject.org</a>. Tor Weather is a web application used
to allow tor relay operators to sign up for notices when their relay is offline,
drops below a threshold of bandwidth served, and receive notifications when a
new version of tor is released. This version of the web application was written
by the Wesleyan University Humantarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS)
team working on Tor for their summer project, <a href="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/" title="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/">http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/</a>.</li>
<li>Karsten started improving metrics-db performance, so that it can scale to
five years of data with 10K relays and 5K bridges. This included a few tricks
to avoid parsing the same data twice. Also changed the database schema to use
SQL arrays to store bandwidth histories, which is apparently a less used part of
PostgreSQL, because he found a confirmed bug in PostgreSQL 8.2 (released
2006-12-05).</li>
<li>Karsten found two major, if not blocking, bugs in Torouter when run on the
suggested Buffalo hardware. The Excito hardware does not have these problems.
The bug numbers are 2334,
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334</a>, and 2376,

<li>Karsten found and fixed a problematic bridge sanitizer bug that made us
keep original IP addresses in reject lines. Updated metrics-db and sanitized
all bridge descriptors since May 2008 once again. The latter kept two of our
computers busy for 2.5 weeks.</li>
<li>Karsten started with exporting bridge pool assignments and restarted
discussion about preserving hashed IP addresses in bridge descriptors.</li>
<li>Karsten upgraded Torperfs to output information about which circuits they
used for measuring download times. Made data available on metrics website.
Added new graphs combining all Torperf sources and showing the fraction of
timeouts and failures. Started Torperfs with custom entry guard selection
strategies.</li>
<li>Karsten talked to Björn Scheuermann and Florian Tschorsch about
performance improvements in Tor. Working on a patch with them to be included in
Tor 0.2.3.x.</li>
<li>Karsten improved graphs on metrics-web by adding more countries and by
allowing users to customize the graph image resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More reliable download mechanism.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sebastian and Erinn started to tackle Thandy and Hudson work. They solved
the Hudson issue on Windows and made a good deal of progress on getting Thandy
set up, understanding the different roles and responsibilities of each in the
Thandy system. Installing files by copying into the right place works, but the
packaging db that would be required for TBB is not yet working.</li>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>We need a better understanding of how much anonymity the Tor network provides against a partial network adversary who observes and/or operates some of the network. Specifically, we want to understand the chances that this class of adversary can observe a user&#39;s traffic coming into the network and also the corresponding traffic exiting the network.</p>

<p>Most of our graphs historically have looked at the total number of relays over time. But this simple scalar doesn&#39;t take into account relay capacity, exit policies, geographic or network location, etc.</p>

<p>One concrete problem from this bad metric is that when many new relays show up (e.g. due to a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/relays-diff-2011-01-28.png">political event</a>), we really don&#39;t have any insight about how the diversity of the new relays compares to the rest of the network. The simplistic metric also gets misused in academic research papers to produce misleading results like &quot;I can sign up 2% of the Tor relays and capture 50% of the paths,&quot; when what they mean is &quot;I can provide half the capacity in the Tor network and capture half the paths.&quot;</p>

<p>There are four parts to this research problem. First, we need a broad array of metrics that reflect various instances of our partial network adversary. Second, we need to understand for each metric how stable it is (sensitivity analysis) and what changes in the Tor network would efficiently improve (or harm) it. Third, we should make the calculations as realistic as possible based on actual Tor client behavior. Last, we need a better infrastructure for comparing the safety impact from alternate design scenarios, for example different path selection or route balancing algorithms.</p>

<p>We&#39;d love to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/research">work with you</a> to help answer these questions.</p>

<p><strong>Part one: new metrics</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://metrics.torproject.org/network.html">network graphs</a> on our metrics site show the number of relays and advertised capacity over time. More importantly, we&#39;ve archived all the <a href="http://metrics.torproject.org/data.html#relaydesc">relay descriptors and network consensus documents</a> going back to 2004. So now we can ask some questions to better capture the safety of the network over time.</p>

<p>What is the entropy of path selection over time? When we add really fast relays, the capacity of the network goes up but the safety of the network can go down because it gets less balanced. We can start with a simple approximation of a Tor client&#39;s path selection behavior — e.g., choose the first hop randomly weighted by bandwidth, and choose the final hop randomly weighted by bandwidth from among the nodes that can exit to port 80. I&#39;m particularly interested in the entropy of the first hop and the third hop, since those are the key points for the anonymity Tor provides against a partial network adversary. Calculating entropy on the probability distribution of possible first hops is easy (as is last hops), and it&#39;s worth looking at these individual components so we have better intuition about where our anonymity comes from. Then we&#39;d also want to look at the unified metric (probability distribution of first cross last), which in the simple approximation is the sum of the two entropies.</p>

<p>Then we should do the same entropy calculations, but lumping relays together based on various shared characteristics. For example, country diversity: what&#39;s the entropy of path selection over time when you treat all relays in Germany as one big relay, all relays in France as one big relay, etc? How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29">autonomous system (AS)</a> based diversity, where all the relays in AT&amp;T&#39;s network are lumped together?</p>

<p>Another angle to evaluate is what expected fraction of paths have the first and last hop in the same country, or the same AS, or the same city, or the same continent. What expected fraction of paths cross at least one ocean? How about looking at the AS-level paths <em>between</em> relays, like the research from <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#feamster:wpes2004">Feamster</a> or <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#DBLP:conf/ccs/EdmanS09">Edman</a>? What user locations are more safe or less safe in the above metrics?</p>

<p>It&#39;s plausible to imagine we can also gain some intuition when looking at the <em>possible diversity</em> rather than the entropy. How many ASes or countries total are represented in the network at a given time?</p>

<p>The goal here isn&#39;t to come up with the one true metric for summarizing Tor&#39;s safety. Rather, we need to recognize that there are many threat models to consider at once, so we need many different views into what types of safety the network can offer.</p>

<p><strong>Part two: how robust are these metrics?</strong></p>

<p>For each of the above metrics, how stable are they when you add or remove a few relays? Are certain relays critical to the safety of the Tor network? One way to look at this question is to graph the fall-off of safety as you remove relays from the network, in one case choosing victims randomly and in another choosing them to optimally harm the network. In the latter case, I expect it will look pretty dire. Then look at the same scenario, but now look at the safety of the network as you remove <em>capacity</em> from the network. For example, consider that the adversary&#39;s cost of removing a relay is equal to its capacity. Then explore these attacks again, but rather than looking at attacking individual relays look at attacks on ASes, countries, or continents.</p>

<p>Then look at the robustness over time: is an adversary that can knock out X% of the capacity in the network (for various values of X) getting more or less influential as the network grows? How about an adversary who can knock out an absolute capacity of K bytes for various values of K?</p>

<p>From the other direction, are there certain geographic or network locations where adding relays with a given capacity will most influence your safety metrics? This influence could be positive (&quot;where should I put my relay to best help the Tor network?&quot;) or negative (&quot;where should I put my relay to best attack users?&quot;).</p>

<p>Is there any relationship between the rate of new relay arrival (e.g. during political events or after popular conferences) and the level of diversity of these relays?</p>

<p><strong>Part three: how good was the simple approximation?</strong></p>

<p>While the above calculations assume a simplified path selection model, the <a href="https://git.torproject.org/tor/doc/spec/path-spec.txt">reality</a> is more complex. Clients avoid using more than one relay from a given &quot;/16&quot; network or <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#ManyRelays">family</a> in their paths. They only use relays with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards">Guard</a> <a href="https://git.torproject.org/tor/doc/spec/dir-spec.txt">flag</a> for their first hop. They read weighting parameters from the consensus and use them to avoid Guard-flagged nodes for positions other than the first hop and avoid Exit-flagged nodes for positions other than the last hop, in proportion to how much capacity is available in each category. They track how long it takes them to build circuits, and preemptively discard the slowest 20% of their paths.</p>

<p>Accounting for all of these behaviors (especially the last one) will be hard, and you&#39;ll want to work closely with the Tor developers to make sure you&#39;re moving in the right direction. But even if you don&#39;t handle all of them, having a more realistic sense of how clients behave should allow you to better capture the safety in the live Tor network. If you want extra feedback, you can compare your path selection predictions with <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data/moria-50kb.extradata">paths that Tor chooses in practice</a> (full data <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html#performance">here</a>).</p>

<p>We should rerun the above experiments with the more accurate client behavior, and see if any of the results change substantially, and if so, why. These changes are great places to recognize and reconsider tradeoffs between what we should do for maximum safety according to these metrics vs what we should do to optimize other metrics like performance and vulnerability to other attacks. Some of these differences are intentional; for example, we don&#39;t give the Guard flag to every relay because we want to reduce the churn of entry guards. But others are due to design mistakes; for example, we are probably not giving the Guard flag out as broadly as we should, and I imagine that really hurts the network&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>How far away is the &quot;optimal&quot; approximation curve you produced in part one from the &quot;in practice&quot; curve here? How does the divergence from the optimal look over time? That is, were we at 50% of optimal back in 2007, but now we&#39;re only at 20%?</p>

<p><strong>Part four: consider alternate designs</strong></p>

<p>Once we&#39;ve looked at how safe the Tor network has been over time for our broad array of metrics, we should do experiments to evaluate alternate network designs.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<p>A) If we give out Guard flags according to some other algorithm, how much safety can we get back?</p>

<p>B) In Tor 0.2.1.x we started load balancing based on <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torflow/trunk/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.BwAuthorities">active bandwidth measurements</a>, so we use the bandwidth weights in the network consensus rather than the weights in each relay descriptor. We know that change <a href="http://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html?graph=torperf&amp;start=2009-08-01&amp;end=2009-10-01#torperf">improved performance</a>, but at what cost to safety?</p>

<p>C) What happens to the network diversity if we <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2286">put a low cap</a> on the bandwidth weighting of any node that hasn&#39;t been assigned a measurement by the bandwidth authorities yet, to protect against relays that lie about their bandwidth? If there&#39;s no real effect, we should do it; but if there&#39;s a large effect, we should find a better plan.</p>

<p>D) If we move forward with our plans to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1854">discard all relays under a given bandwidth capacity</a>, how will various choices of bandwidth threshold impact the network&#39;s safety?</p>

<p>E) How about if we discard the X% of paths with the highest expected latency, as <a href="http://swiki.cc.gatech.edu:8080/ugResearch/uploads/7/ImprovingTor.pdf">suggested</a> by Stephen Rollyson?</p>

<p>F) What if some Tor users choose their paths to optimize a different network property (like latency or jitter), as <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#DBLP:conf/pet/SherrBL09">suggested</a> by Micah Sherr? The infrastructure you&#39;ve built to measure diversity here should apply there too.</p>

<p>G) If only a given fraction of exit relays support IPv6, how much does it reduce your anonymity to be going to an IPv6-only destination?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve put a lot of effort in the past year into understanding <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow">how to improve Tor&#39;s performance</a>, but many of these design changes involve trading off safety for performance, and we still have very little understanding about how much safety Tor offers in the first place. Please help!</p>

	      <p>We&#39;re glad that the Internet Service Providers in Egypt are announcing their routes to the world and have <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet.shtml">rejoined the Internet</a>. We are concerned because it is possible that traffic crossing the Egyptian border is being recorded and possibly saved for future use. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">Correctly using Tor</a> to and from Egyptian destinations will keep your traffic anonymous.</p>

<p>Tor separates who you are from where you are going on the Internet. It&#39;s up to you, the user, to choose where you share your personal information. Currently, we do not try very hard to hide that you are using Tor. In the past few years, we haven&#39;t needed to hide. Tor looks like an SSL connection on the wire. Your local ISP, if they are very clever, could map your current connections from your assigned IP address to the list of public Tor relays. This would only tell them you are using Tor, not where you are going on the Internet. We do offer <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">bridge relays</a>, which are semi-public relays published in a few selective ways. By using bridges, your ISP is unlikely to figure out you are using Tor. We need thousands more bridges, please <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay">join the Tor network</a> to help others.</p>

<p>Many years ago, we theorized this arms race could happen. Recent events have turned theory into reality. We are working on improvements to make it much more difficult to detect Tor usage. These methods include <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/176-revising-handshake.txt">normalization of our TLS usage</a> and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-pluggable-transport.txt">tunneling</a> Tor through other protocols, such as XMPP, HTTPS, and HTTP.</p>

<p>Thanks to some <a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/en/egypt_blackout/">funding from Avaaz</a>, we&#39;ve also begun experimenting with ways to make Tor perform better on satellite and mesh networks. We have Tor working well on <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">mobile phone 3G and 4G connections</a>. Tor over <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Very_small_aperture_terminal">VSAT</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Broadband_Global_Area_Network">BGAN</a> connections does work, however it needs more research into how to better handle the variable latencies and varying available bandwidth on such connections. The improvements that result from this research will benefit those with little to no Internet access, whether due to political unrest, natural disasters, or remote locations, who nonetheless seek to keep their online activities safe.</p>

	      <p>Announcing the vastly improved <a href="https://weather.torproject.org/">Tor Weather</a>!</p>

<p>The new weather incorporates many new features designed to make it far more useful to relay operators new and old.</p>

<p>The new Tor Weather now checks the current consensus and can notify the relay operators if:</p>

<ul>
<li>their node is offline for a specified period of time,</li>
<li>their node has been seeing very little usage,</li>
<li>their node&#39;s Tor version is out of date,</li>
<li>and if they&#39;ve passed the threshold to receive a free Tor t-shirt.</li>
</ul>

<p>This complete re-write and enhancement of Tor Weather was done by <a href="http://ndanner.web.wesleyan.edu/">Professor Danner&#39;s</a> students during their summer <a href="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/">The Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software at Wesleyan University</a> course.

Thanks to our own Kaner for mentoring the students and integrating their changes into the infrastructure.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>The current state of affairs in Egypt looks quite bleak for people using Vodafone, Orange, TE Data, and other well-known service providers. It is reported that each of those companies was ordered by the Egyptian government to turn down their internet services. The nature of the order and its legality is of course very unclear at this time. What is known is that nearly in perfect unison many Egyptian ISPs turned down their BGP route announcements to countries outside of Egypt and from what we&#39;ve been able to gather they&#39;re also not peering with each other. The cables connecting ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FALCON_(cable_system)">FLAG</a> and <a href="http://www.seabone.net/">SEABONE</a>) Egypt to the world are still <em>physically</em> intact.</p>

<p>The impact of de-peering is significant; even if someone is able to get packets directly to the edge routers of TE Data or another ISP, no response will be forthcoming. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml">Renesys</a>, <a href="http://stat.ripe.net/egypt/">RIPE</a>, and <a href="http://bgpmon.net/blog/?p=450">BGPmon</a> have fantastic technical details for those without access to an active BGP router.</p>

<p>At this point it is also well-known that the ISP Noor has been up through the entire event. With access to systems inside of Egypt, we have discovered that it appears to be entirely unfiltered - Tor works perfectly, controversial websites are not blocked, and it is even quite fast compared to our systems on other Egyptian networks. As of very late last night, systems from Noor were still unable to reach systems on TE Data or other networks in Egypt. Early this morning it appears that another ISP, Etisalat (AS36992), returned to the Internet (via nileonline.palermo7.pal.seabone.net) and we&#39;re working with contacts in Egypt to test any possible filtering and to ensure that Tor is functional on their network.</p>

<p>In our tests of the TE Data network before it disconnected, we found very heavy handed but sloppy filtering. Tests of popular websites revealed that TE Data filtered based on IP blocklists, they did not tamper with DNS queries, they did not trigger TCP resets on keywords, nor did they attempt to perform any kind of Man-In-The-Middle attacks on SSL or SSH connections. While it is possible that TE Data may have layer seven filtering or Deep Packet Inspection capabilities, it does not appear to have used any advanced filtering methods.</p>

<p>While the seemingly unfiltered nature of Noor&#39;s network is a positive development and sharply contrasts with the heavy filtering of TE Data&#39;s network, we have no methods for discovering data retention policies or wiretapping capabilities of any of the available networks in Egypt. We urge all people in Egypt to consider that any ISP may log data and depending on political outcomes, it may not be favorable to have easy to trace records of your online activities.</p>

<p>Many Egyptians are also using dial up services that route through the Egyptian controlled state telecommunications systems. While on the face this seems safe and it may very well be safer than a known filtered or probably wiretapped network, it&#39;s certainly not outside of the capabilities of the Egyptian authorities to decode or analyse these kinds of communications. We urge people who are using dial up systems or leased lines, VSAT or even BGAN connections to be cautious. The nature of any internet connection has a variable difficulty for monitoring but it is by no means impossible. That&#39;s why we&#39;re working so hard on Tor because the world needs software for traffic analysis resistance; the internet doesn&#39;t have this for free and certainly not in a country with a highly centralized internet architecture.</p>

<p>There is a serious trade off to be made by users in hostile network environments with major political instability: Tor usage is possibly detectable with a skilled adversary. Connections made with questionable &quot;privacy&quot; or &quot;security&quot; proxy services are certainly easier than detecting Tor because of their static nature. The same is true of VPN services: all of these things are probably detectable with the right understanding and the proper equipment. It goes without saying that entirely unprotected connections to known unfavorable sites or services is detectable and well within the reach of the Egyptian network operators.</p>

<p>Please understand that while we make no promises, we believe that Tor is currently the best option for people in this situation. It&#39;s what we use when we&#39;re in Egypt and it&#39;s what we think will serve people the best in Egypt when they have a network connection to the rest of the internet.</p>

<p>The number of users in Egypt in the last week has skyrocketed:
 <img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/eg-users2-2011-01-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The number of bridges run around the world has increased remarkably:
 <img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/running-bridges-2011-01-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Most impressively, the number of fully public Tor relays has increased:
 <img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/relays-diff-2011-01-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It appears that the Tor network itself has gained bandwidth capacity and geographical scope thanks to people concerned with the situation in Egypt. If you&#39;d like to get involved, we&#39;d love it if you could help by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">running a Tor relay or a Tor bridge</a>.</p>

<p>Update: As of late January 30th, most of Egypt&#39;s BGP routes for residential access has been pulled from the Internet.</p>
