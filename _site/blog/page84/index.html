          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>What do you use Tor for? Why do you need it? What has Tor done for you? We need your stories.</p>

<p>We have plenty of practice explaining how Tor works, from technical specifications, design documents, academic papers, and popular presentation. And of course, the code is all open-source.</p>

<p>But explaining why Tor is important is more of a challenge. We can speak in the abstract about the importance of free speech and privacy on the internet, but no abstract statement is quite so persuasive as a real-world example.</p>

<p>We know these examples are out there. We regularly hear from vulnerable populations and people who need to cope with surveillance. We are approached by people who need Tor to stay safe at work, whether they are going after criminals on behalf of their governments, or going after the criminals who run their governments, or just regular people trying to preserve their privacy.</p>

<p>But naturally, most of these stories are ones that we don&#39;t have permission to share. After all, it would hardly be in keeping with our pro-privacy beliefs to publish tech-support requests!</p>

<p>Similarly, because we don&#39;t gather sensitive data on our network, we cannot (as some networks do) publish regular reports on what kinds of uses we are seeing. (We do not collect this data because we believe that a privacy network should put privacy foremost, and that the best way to protect people&#39;s information is not to collect it in the first place.) This is fantastic when it comes to protecting users against advertisers, censors, miscellaneous snoops, and the secret police of authoritarian regimes. But it isn&#39;t working out so well when we are asked by donors and other potential allies who want to know what supporting Tor means in less technical terms.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we work on Tor because everybody has the right to their own voice. So while this is on the one hand a plea for information we can use to tell the world about the importance of what we&#39;re accomplishing (and try to get donations to do more of it), it&#39;s also a request born of the notion that nobody is more qualified to tell your own story than you are.</p>

<p>So, please send us your stories so we can share them with the world. If email works, you can send it to <a href="mailto:tor-assistants@torproject.org">tor-assistants@torproject.org</a>, subject line &quot;Why I Use Tor&quot;. And of course, you can just post a comment here.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t use names, but if too many details can reveal who you are, please err on the side of caution. There is no point in responding to our request if it puts you in danger. That said: why do you use Tor? Whether you use it to look at <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/03/08/the-cute-cat-theory-talk-at-etech/">cute cats</a> or political blogs, we&#39;d like to know. And since we designed Tor with privacy in mind, we can&#39;t know unless you tell us.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>I was invited to speak at the annual technical conference of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, <a href="http://nnedv.org/" title="http://nnedv.org/">http://nnedv.org/</a>. Over the past few years, I&#39;ve been personally involved with helping victims and survivors of abuse. In many cases, it has been education and helping them understand what&#39;s possible on the Internet, methods to protect their privacy, and methods to control what data trails they leave behind. I&#39;ve been deeply disturbed after meeting survivors of sexual slavery, human trafficking, and child abuse. The realities of life for these people while they were being abused, and the systematic failures of the systems set up to protect and help them, is shocking. The law enforcement officers and those offering services and direct support to these victims often suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Everyone involved with the results of abuse seems to need help all around.</p>

<p>Many people simply assume that the only answer is to disconnect and never go online again. However, often your data is online, even if you are not. Many services, friends, and access to information is increasingly available online only. Disconnecting isn&#39;t really an option, especially if you need to find support, shelter, and services to help you. Conversely, if you&#39;re a survivor, part of the healing process is to help others. The ability to go online anonymously and join forums, chat, or email with others in a bad place can be the difference between life and death. This is also true for those in law enforcement and support services. They need to share with people, heal and be healed. In many cases, they don&#39;t want this associated to anything a search engine, future employer, or current partners will find. They cherish their anonymity.</p>

<p>I did two presentations, the first was loosely about cloud computing, centralized reporting, and putting your victim&#39;s and survivor&#39;s data online. The core idea was to transfer knowledge, not recommend any one product or solution. I believe people can better assess risks when they understand the data to support their decisions. This presentation is here, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgrani...</a>.</p>

<p>The second presentation was more about Tor and how survivors and victims can and have used Tor in the past to regain some control of their online privacy and anonymity. This second presentation is here, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-S...</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad NNEDV exists, and that we can help, even if in some small way, such as doing a couple of presentations.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>There is a growing cacophony that a fully identified, real name policy for the Internet will solve all of our problems relating to crime, bullying, harassment, and everything else. This idea is furthered along by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/randi-zuckerberg-anonymity-online_n_910892.html">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/10/eric-schmidt-privacy-stan_n_677224.html">Google</a>, and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/06/25/national-strategy-trusted-identities-cyberspace">US White House</a>.</p>

<p>As just one example of how this is an over-simplified argument, it seems people are continuing to forget their childhoods. As a kid, many of you were bullied and harassed at school. You knew the kids picking on you at lunch, at recess, at morning before class, and after school. Further, you knew their parents, where they lived, and generally who they were outside of school. This bullying and harassment may have continued through High School, into College, and through your work life. Again, you knew their real names and far more about them than Google, Facebook, or the US Govt will ever hope to know. A real name world hasn&#39;t made life better, more civil, or safer for millions of kids growing up in it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent time talking to kids that have been bullied online and in real life. It&#39;s all done with real names via Facebook, text messaging, at recess, after school, via twitter, etc. It spreads to those trying to stop it, such as their parents who get involved to defend their kid. These are all real name environments. Kids don&#39;t call it bullying. It&#39;s called &#39;starting static&#39; these days to skirt the word &#39;bullying&#39;. Regardless of the term, it&#39;s frequently done via real names.</p>

<p>There is a small, but growing, set of voices realizing that real name policies aren&#39;t all they are promising to provide, namely safety. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms">EFF/Jillian York</a>, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/07/25/google-and-the-loss-of-online-anonymity/">GigOM/Matthew Ingram</a>, and <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/4chan-founder-moot-anonymity-authenticity-zuc">moot</a> have all made cases why anonymity is important on the Internet. This forced dichotomy is not new, <a href="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/6095/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html">Karina Rigby</a> wrote about it back in 1995.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve learned over the past few years that the ability to remain anonymous has led to people instituting positive change, such as the &#39;Arab Spring&#39;, and to being able to research and question authority without the fear of punishment and/or death to them and their relatives in repressive regimes. Further, the option of anonymity can allow you to explore new topics, learn about new things, and join new communities. You are freed from the baggage of your own history. People can change.</p>

<p>Jerks can use anonymity too. Or they can use their real names. It would be an interesting study to see the abuse/complaint report numbers for Facebook, Google+, and other real name environments versus similar environments without such a real name requirement. It would be equally interesting to learn if the presence of an authority figure versus real names provides less abuse/complaints from the members. This post is skipping the entire topic of trojan software acting in your name, such as botnets collating millions of identities to do the bidding of others.</p>

<p>The power is in the beholder, not the technology itself. Use your anonymity for good, while you still have it. You should be in control of your identity, not someone else.</p>

	      <p>Hi all. A new release of <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> is now available. This completes the codebase refactoring project that&#39;s been a year in the works and provides numerous performance, usability, and stability improvements...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Relay Setup Wizard</p>

<p>Setting up a relay can be tricky for new users. In headless environments this means navigating Tor&#39;s massive, user unfriendly man page and even when Vidalia&#39;s an option it makes relatively poor exit configurations. Starting arm before Tor now provides instructions for auto-generating a good relay setup...</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard1.png">Selection for what you&#39;d like to be</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard2.png">Picking your relay options</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard3.png">Confirmation for the configuration it&#39;s making</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Menu Interface</p>

<p>All of arm&#39;s capabilities are now available via a <a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_menu.png">simple menu interface</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Arm Gui Prototype</p>

<p>Over this summer Kamran Khan has been <a href="http://inspirated.com/2011/06/28/summer-of-code-progress-graphs-logs-and-acid">working on a GTK frontend</a> for arm as part of Google Summer of Code. The initial prototype is ready!</p></li>
<li><p>Performance Improvements</p>

<p>Several arm and TorCtl performance fixes providing a 83% faster startup time, 12% lower memory usage, and instantaneous shutdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved Platform Support</p>

<p>Vastly better support for Mac OSX. Arm has also been <a href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze-backports/tor-arm">backported to Debian Squeeze</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maverick-backports/+bug/721886">Ubuntu Lucid / Maverick</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>... etc</p>

<p>Options for requesting a new identity, shutting down Tor, reconnecting if Tor&#39;s been restarted and <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/releaseNotes.php#1.4.3">many, many bugfixes</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
