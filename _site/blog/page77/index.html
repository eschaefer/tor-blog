          <p>The new release of Vidalia 0.2.12 is out. We&#39;d also like to congratulate Tom√°s Touceda on his first release and thank him for all his work and patience in getting this out!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p><strong>0.2.12 10-Apr-2011</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Vidalia&#39;s SVN repository has been migrated to Git. All branches but
master have been archived for later review, since SVN trunk had changed
significantly; they should be reviewed later to determine whether
they can and should still be merged. All \version $Id$ headers have been
removed since Git does not support $Id$.</li>
<li>As part of the move, Vidalia&#39;s Trac is now at:
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/" title="https://trac.torproject.org/">https://trac.torproject.org/</a>
All Trac numbers in Vidalia 0.2.12 and beyond refer to the new Trac
entries. The old Trac is archived for posterity at:
<a href="https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia" title="https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia">https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia</a></li>
<li>Add support for Tor&#39;s ControlSocket as an alternative to ControlPort. It
can be used for Linux maintainers to build a better default interaction
between Tor and Vidalia by just setting the right permissions and file
owner on the socket file for the connection. Using ControlSocket means
you don&#39;t need to worry about authentication methods with ControlPort.
Resolves bug 2091.</li>
<li>Add a way to edit arbitrary torrc entries while Tor is running. Now
Vidalia users have more flexibility for configuring Tor. This change
doesn&#39;t replace editing torrc directly, because on some systems
(like Debian) Tor can&#39;t write to its torrc file. Resolves bug 2083.</li>
<li>Remove Vidalia&#39;s direct dependency on OpenSSL. This dependency had
caused Vidalia to fail to run on FreeBSD (due to a bug in the FreeBSD
ports collection) and Fedora 14 (due to an incompatibility between
OpenSSL and Fedora&#39;s SELinux configuration). Resolves bug 2287 and
2611.</li>
<li>Restore compatibility with Windows 2000. An update to the MiniUPnPc
library had introduced an unnecessary dependency on a system library
not included in Windows 2000. Fixes bug 2612.</li>
<li>Fix how the advanced message log window displays message updates when
messages are coming in too quickly, for example when you&#39;re listening
to debug-level messages from Tor. Fixes bug 2093.</li>
<li>Add a what&#39;s this? link to the bridge option to explain in a more verbose
fashion what being a bridge involves. Resolves bug 1995.</li>
<li>Prompt users to restart Tor after changing the path to torrc. Fixes bug
2086.</li>
<li>Disable the directory port configuration field when configuring a
bridge. A bridge does not need to operate a separate directory port,
and operating one can make a bridge easier to detect. Fixes bug 2431.</li>
<li>When Vidalia asks Tor for a bridge&#39;s usage history before anyone has
used it, correctly report that no clients have used the bridge recently.
Previously, it would incorrectly warn that it was unable to retrieve the
bridge&#39;s usage history. Fixes bug 2186.</li>
</ul>

          <p>We are <strong>temporarily</strong> discontinuing the Tor IM Browser Bundles because of a <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/11110">bug</a> in Pidgin that results in DNS leaks when using XMPP. We&#39;re currently working on trying to find a fix or a workaround for this in <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1676">our bug tracker</a>. Please feel free to give us a hand there or just follow along if you want to track progress. We hope to have a fix or workaround soon so that we can begin making Tor IM Browser Bundles again, with more confidence that our users are safe. Again, we are very sorry for the inconvenience and abrupt announcement, but we hope to have things back to normal very quickly. Thanks for your patience!</p>

          <p>Tor 0.2.2.24-alpha fixes a variety of bugs, including a big bug that
 prevented Tor clients from effectively using &quot;multihomed&quot; bridges,
 that is, bridges that listen on multiple ports or IP addresses so users
 can continue to use some of their addresses even if others get blocked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical
address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical
address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it should be
able to advertise those addresses independently and any non-blocked
addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.x. Fixes
bug 2510.</li>
<li>If you configured Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and
configured Tor to use bridge B instead, it would happily continue
to use bridge A if it&#39;s still reachable. While this behavior is
a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it&#39;s a
dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.</li>
<li>Directory authorities now use data collected from their own
uptime observations when choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag
to relays, instead of trusting the uptime value the relay reports in
its descriptor. This change helps prevent an attack where a small
set of nodes with frequently-changing identity keys can blackhole
a hidden service. (Only authorities need upgrade; others will be
fine once they do.) Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection
from the outside before we&#39;ve started our reachability tests,
triggering a warning: &quot;ORPort found reachable, but I have no
routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success.&quot; This
bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller
like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a
REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED status event. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha;
fixes bug 1172.</li>
<li>Make directory authorities more accurate at recording when
relays that have failed several reachability tests became
unreachable, so we can provide more accuracy at assigning Stable,
Guard, HSDir, etc flags. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Resolves bug 2716.

<ul>
<li>Fix an issue that prevented static linking of libevent on
some platforms (notably Linux). Fixes bug 2698; bugfix on
versions 0.2.1.23/0.2.2.8-alpha (the versions introducing
the --with-static-libevent configure option).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We now ask the other side of a stream (the client or the exit)
for more data on that stream when the amount of queued data on
that stream dips low enough. Previously, we wouldn&#39;t ask the
other side for more data until either it sent us more data (which
it wasn&#39;t supposed to do if it had exhausted its window!) or we
had completely flushed all our queued data. This flow control fix
should improve throughput. Fixes bug 2756; bugfix on the earliest
released versions of Tor (svn commit r152).</li>
<li>Avoid a double-mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a
transparent proxy connection. (We thought we had fixed this in
0.2.2.23-alpha, but it turns out our fix was checking the wrong
connection.) Fixes bug 2757; bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha (the original
bug) and 0.2.2.23-alpha (the incorrect fix).</li>
<li>When warning about missing zlib development packages during compile,
give the correct package names. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Directory authorities now log the source of a rejected POSTed v3
networkstatus vote.</li>
<li>Make compilation with clang possible when using
--enable-gcc-warnings by removing two warning optionss that clang
hasn&#39;t implemented yet and by fixing a few warnings. Implements
ticket 2696.</li>
<li>When expiring circuits, use microsecond timers rather than
one-second timers. This can avoid an unpleasant situation where a
circuit is launched near the end of one second and expired right
near the beginning of the next, and prevent fluctuations in circuit
timeout values.</li>
<li>Use computed circuit-build timeouts to decide when to launch
parallel introduction circuits for hidden services. (Previously,
we would retry after 15 seconds.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create the /var/run/tor directory on startup on OpenSUSE if it is
not already created. Patch from Andreas Stieger. Fixes bug 2573.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Modernize the doxygen configuration file slightly. Fixes bug 2707.</li>
<li>Resolve all doxygen warnings except those for missing documentation.
Fixes bug 2705.</li>
<li>Add doxygen documentation for more functions, fields, and types.</li>
</ul>

          <p>Hello everyone, for those who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m the one that&#39;s taking care of Vidalia these days.</p>

<p>The other day I was contacted by paulproteus in the #vidalia IRC channel about an initiative they (OpenHatch) are organizing called &quot;Build It&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The idea</strong></p>

<p>Open Source projects live and die depending on contributors and people that want to see the project evolve, but this isn&#39;t so easy sometimes.
The guys behind the Build It initiative have a theory about this difficulty:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...lots of users of free desktop software want to get involved in customizing or contributing to the project&#39;s development, but they haven&#39;t gotten to the first step of getting the program to compile.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I&#39;m a Gentoo user for years now, the compilation part comes naturally to me and I haven&#39;t thought of this issue that way but it&#39;s an interesting approach.</p>

<p><strong>The event</strong></p>

<p>This week, people involved in Vidalia and other Open Source projects will be at a specific time online to help users (future developers, may be :) ) jump over this compilation wall. Particularly, Vidalia is scheduled for this Friday at 13:00 UTC in the same place as usual: #vidalia at OFTC.</p>

<p>While this event is taking place on a particular day and a particular time, I&#39;m online all the time (even when I&#39;m not in front of the computer). So if you want to contribute to Vidalia or any of the projects around Tor (or Tor itself), don&#39;t hesitate, just get online and start typing, but be patient and stick around. Also, you&#39;d probably want to read this: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en</a></p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Buld It initiative, you can ask in #openhatch at Freenode, or read here: <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build_it" title="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build\_it">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build_it</a></p>
