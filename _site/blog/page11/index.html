          <p>Welcome to the twentieth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor 0.2.4.22 is out</h1>

<p>A <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032956.html">new version of the Tor stable branch was released</a> on May 16th: “Tor 0.2.4.22 backports numerous high-priority fixes from the Tor 0.2.5 alpha release series. These include blocking all authority signing keys that may have been affected by the OpenSSL ‘heartbleed’ bug, choosing a far more secure set of TLS ciphersuites by default, closing a couple of memory leaks that could be used to run a target relay out of RAM, and several others.”</p>

<p>For more details, look at the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/2ee56e4c2:/ChangeLog">full changelog</a>. The source is available at the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">usual location</a>. Packages should be coming shortly, if not <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/tor/news/20140517T102023Z.html">already available</a>.</p>

<h1>Digital Restrictions Management and Firefox</h1>

<p>Mozilla’s decision to <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/reconciling-mozillas-mission-and-w3c-eme/">support playing media with digital restrictions</a> in Firefox by implementing the W3C EME specification has raised a fair amount of controversy. Paul Crable  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032947.html">wanted to know</a> what it meant for the Tor Browser.</p>

<p>Mike Perry <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032985.html">answered</a> that “simply removing the DRM will be trivial, and it will be high on our list of tasks”.</p>

<p>But he also explained his worries regarding a “per-device unique identifier” that Firefox would provide as part of the implementation: “it is likely that this identifier will soon be abused by all sorts of entities, […] quickly moving on to the advertising industry (why not play a short device-linked DRM video with your banner ad? You get a persistent, device-specific tracking identifier as part of the deal!). I think it is also quite likely that many arbitrary sites will actually deny access to users who do not provide them with such a device-id, if only due to ease of increased revenue generation from a fully identified userbase.”</p>

<p>Mike has <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.privacy/3jA9zt1pXVo">raised the issue</a> on Mozilla’s dev-privacy mailing-list where Henri Sivonen replied that device-identifying information will be hashed together with a “per-origin browser-generated secret“ that “persists until the user asks the salt to be forgotten”. So it does not look as gloom as it initially appeared. As always, the devil is in the details.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>David Goulet <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006872.html">reported</a> on the status of the development of Torsocks 2.0, the library for safely using applications with Tor.</p>

<p>Karsten Loesing <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/10-years-collecting-tor-directory-data">posted</a> on the Tor Blog to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first archived Tor directory, and discussed the different ways in which the public archive of directory data is being used for research and development.</p>

<p>Karsten also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006884.html">notified</a> the community of a change in the compression algorithm used for the tarballs of archived metrics data, which has reduced their total size from 212 gigabytes to 33 — an 85% gain!</p>

<p><a href="https://gnunet.org/knock">Knock</a> is a variant of port-knocking that might be useful in the future for pluggable transports. “As Knock uses two fields in the TCP header in order to hide information and we explicitly want to be compatible with machines sitting in typical home networks”, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006873.html">writes</a> Julian Kirsch, “we thus created a program which tests if Knock would work in your environment.” Please <a href="https://gnunet.org/knock_nat_tester">give it a try</a> to help the team figure out if Knock could be deployed in the wild.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000581.html">Jesse Victors</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000589.html">Andrea</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000592.html">Nicholas Merrill</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000594.html">Martin A.</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!</p>

<p>Michael Schloh von Bennewitz has been busy analyzing a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9701">disk leak</a> in Tor Browser: when one copies a significant chunk of text to the clipboard, a temporary file is created with its content. Michael found a possible fix and is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006875.html">welcoming reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Nicolas Vigier has been <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2014-May/000050.html">investigating</a> some extra connections made by the Tor Browser on startup to the local resolver and the default port or the SOCKS proxy.</p>

<p>Shawn Nock proved us once more that talking to ISP is key to run Tor relays on high-speed links. Shawn’s exit node was <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004553.html">abruptly shut down by its provider</a> on May 15th. After a well-crafted plea explaining why Tor is important, the provider <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004555.html">restored the service</a> on the very same day!</p>

<p>However, dope457 reported that their provider is now giving them <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004562.html">trouble for being the operator of a non-exit relay</a>, due to a large amount of traffic on the DNS port (53), which is being used as the ORPort by a <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/44EFAF942314F756FC7EA50292D5B383E568A9BD">recently-established Tor relay</a>, as <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004563.html">pointed out</a> by Roman Mamedov.</p>

<p>Now that ICANN is “selling” top-level domain names, Anders Andersson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032974.html">raised concerns</a> about the .onion extension used by Tor. Fortunately, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761">RFC6761</a> defines a process regarding special-use domain names. Last November, Christian Grothoff, Matthias Wachs, Hellekin O. Wolf, and Jacob Appelbaum submitted a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names-02">request to reserve several TLDs used in peer-to-peer systems</a>. Hellekin <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032983.html">sent an update</a> about the procedure: “the current status quo from the IETF so far is that this issue is not a priority”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Local antivirus or firewall applications can prevent Tor from connecting unless they are disabled. Firewall tools that have caused usability issues in the past include Webroot SecureAnywhere AV, Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, Sophos Antivirus for Mac, and Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/">Tor StackExchange site</a> now provides more than 1000 answers to user-supplied questions. However, there are still <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/unanswered">~130 questions</a> which need a good answer, so if you happen to know one then please visit the site and help out.</p>

<p>The majority of the questions are about the <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tor-browser-bundle">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, but <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hidden-services">hidden services</a> also attract a large amount of attention. When it comes to operating systems, there are <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/windows">42 Windows-related questions</a>, while <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tails">questions about Tails</a> and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/whonix">Whonix</a> number nearly 50. All your questions about Tor and related software are welcome.</p>

<p>Blue_Pyro uses Orweb on a mobile phone and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1753/88">wants to save images from websites</a>. Abel of Guardian recommended two options: first, a user can use <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/firefoxprivacy/">Firefox mobile with privacy enhanced options</a>, or one can <a href="https://guardianproject.info/builds/Orfox/latest/">try Orfox</a>, a development version of a Firefox-based browser.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p><a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">Stem</a> is a Python controller library for Tor. It comes with tutorials and generally has pretty good test coverage. The newly-added example scripts, however, don’t yet have unit tests. Damian Johnson suggested ways to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11335">add unit tests for example scripts</a>; if you want to help out, <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git">learn how to get started</a>, start writing unit tests for the example scripts, and then comment on the ticket.</p>

<p>The traffic obfuscator <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html">obfsproxy</a> should <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9823">validate command-line arguments appropriately</a>. Right now, it’s printing an error and continuing, but it should really abort. This sounds like a trivial change, but maybe there’s more to fix in the nearby code. If you like Python and want to give it a try, there’s more information for you on the ticket.</p>

          <p>Today is the 10th anniversary of collecting Tor directory data!</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf">2004 Tor design paper</a> says, &quot;As of mid-May 2004, the Tor network consists of 32 nodes (24 in the US, 8 in Europe), and more are joining each week as the code matures.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, we still have the original relay lists from back then. The <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Ekarsten/directory-2004-05-15-07-31-04">first archived Tor directory</a> dates back to May 15, 2004. It starts with the following lines which are almost human-readable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">signed-directory

</code></pre></div>
<p>As of today, May 15, 2014, there are about 4,600 relays in the Tor network and another 3,300 bridges. In these 10 years, we have collected a total of 212 GiB of bz2-compressed tarballs containing Tor directory data. That&#39;s more than 600 GiB of uncompressed data. And of course, the full archive is publicly <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html">available for download</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Ekarsten/tor-directory-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a small selection of what people do with this fine archive:</p>

<ul>
<li>The metrics portal shows graphs of <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html">network growth over time</a> and <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">estimates of users derived from directory activity</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://exonerator.torproject.org/">ExoneraTor service</a> allows people to look up whether a given IP address was part of the Tor network in the past.</li>
<li>The websites <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a>, <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a>, and <a href="https://compass.torproject.org/">Compass</a> let users explore how specific relays or bridges contribute to the Tor network.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://shadow.github.io/">Shadow Simulator</a> uses archived Tor directory data to generate network topologies that match the real Tor network as close as possible.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://torps.github.io/">Tor Path Simulator</a> uses Tor directory archive data to simulate the effect of changes to Tor&#39;s path selection algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>If people want to use the Tor directory archive for their <a href="https://research.torproject.org/">research</a> or for building new applications, or want to help out with the projects listed above, don&#39;t hesitate to contact us!</p>

<p>Happy 10th birthday, Tor directory archive!</p>

          <p>Welcome to the nineteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.1 is released</h1>

<p>On May 7th, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-361-released">version 3.6.1 of the Tor Browser was released</a>. Apart from updating HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript, the new release mainly solves a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11658">regression experienced by proxy users</a>.</p>

<p>The new version should not error out with “You have configured more than one proxy type” anymore.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for April 2014</h1>

<p>More monthly reports from Tor project members have arrived this week with submissions from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000531.html">Nicolas Vigier</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000533.html">Roger Dingledine</a>.</p>

<p>Roger also sent the report for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000532.html">SponsorF</a>. The <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_04/">Tails team has released theirs</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-May/000114.html">ooniprobe 1.0.2 has been released</a>. The new version brings security fixes, a manpage, a test for Tor bridge reachability among other improvements.</p>

<p>As the Tor blog should <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10022">migrate away from its current decaying software</a>, Eric Schaefer <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/www-team/2014-May/000316.html">wrote</a> to tell that he had extracted all blog posts in a format ready for a static site generator. Comments are also available. One option would be to import them in a dedicated commenting system. Tom Purl has <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/www-team/2014-May/000318.html">setup</a> a test Juvia instance for anyone who wish to give it a shot.</p>

<p>David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-May/000410.html">released</a> a new round of Tor Browser packages modified to include <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>. “Unlike previous bundles […], these ones aren’t configured to use meek automatically. You have to select ‘Configure’ on the network settings screen and then choose meek from the list of transports.” Please give them a try!</p>

<p>Isis Lovecruft <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006856.html">rewrote</a> the email bridge distributor in order to fix some fundamental design problems with the old code. Reviews are welcome.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>A relay operator contacted the Tor Help Desk after seeing the following message in the Tor log: “http status 400 (&quot;Fingerprint is marked rejected&quot;) response from dirserver &#39;128.31.0.34:9131&#39;”.</p>

<p>One might see this message is if one’s relay was found to be vulnerable to the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug and subsequently removed from the Tor consensus. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">Instructions for upgrading one’s relay</a> are on the Tor project’s blog.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the eighteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6 is released</h1>

<p>The long-awaited <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-released">Tor Browser 3.6 was finally declared stable</a> on April 29th. Tor Browser 3.6 is the first version to fully integrate pluggable transports, enabling easier access to the Tor network on censored networks. The browser is based on the latest Firefox ESR 24.5.0 and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.5">includes a new round of security fixes</a>.</p>

<p>When configuring how to access the Tor network, users can now select one of the included list of <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt">obfs3</a> or <a href="https://fteproxy.org/">fte</a> bridges. Using Flashproxy is also an option, but <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto">often requires further configuration</a> on the local firewall and router. Manually specifying <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">bridges</a> is still an option, now with support for the aforementioned pluggable transports.</p>

<p>Many small usability enhancements have been made: Tor error messages are translated, the wording on several dialog windows has been improved based on user feedback, and Mac users now install the browser from the usual disk image format. Turkish localization has also been enabled.</p>

<h1>Tails 1.0 is out</h1>

<p>“Version 1.0 is often an important milestone that denotes the maturity of a free software project. The first public version of what would become Tails was released on June 23 2009 […]. That was almost five years ago. Tails 1.0 marks the 36th stable release since then.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.0/">release announcement</a> could have not said it better. On top of the simple idea of having a system entirely running in memory that guarantees Tor usage for all network connections, Tails has been extended with an USB installer, automatic upgrades, persistence, support for Tor bridges, MAC address spoofing, an extensive and translated documentation and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/">many more features</a>.</p>

<p>Over Tails 0.23, the new version brings security fixes from Firefox and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11464">Tor</a>, an updated I2P, several enhancements to the Tor configuration interface, and the appearance of the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/promote/logo/">new Tails logo</a>.</p>

<p>More details are in the release announcement. For those who have not made use of the integrated updater, time to <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/">download</a> the new version!</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for April 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of April has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000511.html">Georg Koppen</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000513.html">Arthur D.

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>The Tails developers <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032838.html">warned</a> that two fake public keys have been found bearing email addresses associated with the project; do not trust these keys, or anything they may have been used to sign. You can check <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/openpgp_keys/">the real keys</a> used to sign Tails software on the Tails website.</p>

<p>Erinn Clark <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006809.html">alerted</a> users of the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/">Trac-based Tor wiki</a> to the fact that a bug (now fixed) made it possible to register an account with an already-taken username, “overwriting the existing user’s password and thereby taking over the account”. “We recommend users try to login and if you find you are unable to do so, you can reset your password” on the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/reset_password">appropriate Trac page</a>.</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005556.html">previous discussions</a> and a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005674.html">proposal</a> on the topic of how to make hidden services scale, Christopher Baines went on and implemented a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006788.html">prototype</a>, “for one possible design of how to allow distribution in hidden services”. The code and concrete design is up for feedback.</p>

<p>Daniel Martí <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006792.html">sent out</a> a list of proposed revisions — arrived at in discussion with other developers on IRC — to the now slightly outdated proposal 140, which forms the basis of his upcoming Google Summer of Code project to implement consensus diffs and so reduce the amount of information downloaded hourly by Tor clients. Among the proposals are support for microdescriptor consensus diffs and a time limit to prevent the leak of information about when Tor was last used; “ideas about what might be missing or needing an update are welcome”, wrote Daniel.</p>

<p>Alpha releases of Orbot v14 are <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032847.html">now available</a> for testing. They include support for the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit protocols, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/yawning/obfsclient">obfsclient</a>.</p>

<p>Griffin Boyce solicited feedback on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032866.html">first release of Satori</a>, an “app for Google Chrome that distributes circumvention software in a difficult-to-block way and makes it easy for users to check if it’s been tampered with in-transit.”</p>

<p>Kelley Misata <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-summer-2014-dev-meeting-hosted-mozilla">announced</a> on the Tor Blog that this year’s Tor Summer Dev Meeting will be held between June 29th and July 4th at the French offices of Mozilla in Paris.</p>

<p>Also on the blog, Andrew Lewman <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/paypal-account-limits-now-resolved">announced</a> that the temporary limit on donations to the Tor Project through Paypal has now been lifted.</p>

<p>Nicolas Vigier <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-May/000405.html">announced</a> that the Tor Browser test suite will now be run automatically when a new build is ready. The results will be emailed to the tor-qa mailing list.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006820.html">suggested</a> that <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/proposals/236-single-guard-node.txt">proposal 236</a>, which deals with the proposed transition to single guard nodes for Tor clients, should include the retention of multiple guards for directory requests, since “trusting a single source for the completeness and freshness of your directory info is suboptimal.”</p>

<p>Jacob H. Haven, Mikhail Belous, and Noah Rahman each introduced their Tor-related projects for this year’s Google Summer of Code: <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006808.html">Jacob’s project</a> is titled “A Lightweight Censorship Analyzer for Tor”, and aims to “allow non-technical users to monitor censorship of Tor occurring in their country/network”; Mikhail <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006817.html">will work</a> to implement a multicore version of the tor daemon; and Noah <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006821.html">plans</a> on “refactoring Stegotorus more along DRY lines as well as enhancing and updating various handshaking protocols, and getting it ready to merge in upstream changes from its originators at SRI.”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000556.html">NetCologne</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000553.html">fr33tux</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!</p>

<p>Frederic Jacobs invited <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032839.html">comments</a> on an alternative Tor icon designed by a friend “for fun”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Many users alerted the help desk to a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11658">new bug</a> in Tor Browser 3.6 that prevents users from setting a proxy. Developers have said this bug is related to the introduction of Pluggable Transport support; a new Tor Browser release addressing this issue is expected this week.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Tom Ritter wonders how the <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/2041/88">Exit Probability is calculated</a> and wants to know if all values add up to 100 %. If anyone knows a good answer, please don’t hesitate to add it to the question.</p>

<p>user1698 wants to extend the number of Tor relays in a circuit, and asks if it is possible to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/2039/88">have one with 5 or 6 nodes</a>. Tom Ritter suggests that this is only possible when one changes the source code. There is another question which deals with <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/103/88">extending the number of nodes in a circuit</a>: Steven Murdoch warns the user in his answer that under some circumstances it might be possible to de-anonymize a person who is using this technique. Furthermore alaf discusses the performance, throughput and anonymity of longer circuits.</p>

          <p>The first pointfix release of the 3.6 series is available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6.1/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release features a fix for a regression with using a proxy for normal Tor usage. It does not yet allow the configuration of proxies for pluggable transports. We hope to fix that issue in the following point release.</p>

<p>This is not a security release — feel free to keep using TBB 3.6 if it&#39;s working for you.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All Platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>Update HTTPS-Everywhere to 3.5.1</li>
<li>Update NoScript to 2.6.8.22</li>
<li>Bug <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11658">11658</a>: Fix proxy configuration for non-Pluggable Transports users</li>
<li>Backport Pending Tor Patches:</li>
<li>Bug <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8402">8402</a>: Allow Tor proxy configuration while PTs are present</li>
<li>Note: The Pluggable Transports themselves have not been updated to support proxy configuration yet.</li>
</ul></li>
