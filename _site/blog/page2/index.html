	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-eighth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>The EFF concludes its 2014 Tor Challenge</h1>

<p>As Tor Weekly News <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-June/000049.html">reported</a> in June, over the last few months the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been holding its second Tor Challenge to improve the strength and diversity of the Tor network by inspiring people to run Tor relays. The 2014 Challenge is now over, and Rainey Reitman of the EFF posted <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/tor-challenge-inspires-1635-tor-relays">some thoughts</a> on the campaign and its outcome.</p>

<p>1635 Tor relays (including 326 exit relays) were started up or had their capacity increased as part of the 2014 Tor Challenge, compared to 549 at the end of the last campaign in 2011. As Rainey wrote, this number “far exceeded our hopes”; the success can be attributed to a coordinated promotional effort by the EFF, the Free Software Foundation, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and the Tor Project, as well as to “the 1,000 individuals who cared enough to help contribute bandwidth to the Tor network.” Thanks to everyone who participated!</p>

<p>It’s important to remember, though, that new relays only benefit Tor users as long as they stay running. Advice and support from experienced relay operators can always be found on the #tor IRC channel or the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays">tor-relays mailing list</a>; if you missed out on the Tor Challenge this year but still want to contribute to a stronger, more stable Tor network, take a look at the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay">Tor website</a> for advice on how to get started.</p>

<h1>Guardiness and Tor’s directory authorities</h1>

<p>When a Tor relay is first assigned the Guard flag by the directory authorities (or “dirauths”) it sees a dip in the amount of traffic passing through it, because Guard capacity is a scarce resource on the Tor network and, as Roger Dingledine explained <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay">last year</a>, “all the rest of the clients back off from using you for their middle hops, because when they see the Guard flag, they assume that you have plenty of load already from clients using you as their first hop”, an assumption which is only correct after clients have had enough opportunity to select the new guard. With the recent move to single entry guards, an even longer period of time may pass before a young guard can be selected as a first hop by old clients.</p>

<p>“Guardiness”, or GuardFraction, is a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/236-single-guard-node.txt#l101">proposed measurement</a> to let dirauths, and therefore clients, work out how much of a relay’s capacity is being used for first hops by clients, and how much for second and third hops, by finding the fraction of recent consensuses in which the relay has been given the Guard flag; the “dead period” following the assignment of the flag can then be avoided. George Kadianakis <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007489.html">published</a> an analysis of ways in which dirauths’ votes could be extended to include this guardiness measurement, taking into account the time and effort required to parse large numbers of Tor consensuses very quickly. The initial proposal was to ask dirauths to run a script each hour that would extract the data required for parsing into “summary files”: Sebastian Hahn <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007526.html">asked</a> how this measure might fail in different situations, and Peter Palfrader <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007490.html">suggested</a> that loading every consensus into a database for later querying might be more efficient.</p>

<p>“This feature is by far the trickiest part of prop236 (guard node security) and I wanted to inform all dirauths of our plan and ask for feedback on the deployment procedure”, wrote George. If you have any comments to add to the discussion so far, please send them to the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev">tor-dev mailing list</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>The Tails team wants to make sure that all the Debian packages on which Tails relies are “in good shape” before Jessie, the next Debian release, is frozen on 5th November. To that end, the team called for testing both of the <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2014-September/000071.html">software itself</a> and its <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2014-September/001553.html">translations</a> — if you’d like to help, find full instructions and links to the “barely-working” experimental disk images in the announcements.</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>, the pluggable transport that routes Tor traffic through platforms which are “too big to block”, now works with Microsoft Azure in addition to the already-supported Google App Engine and Amazon Web Services. David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007525.html">posted</a> the announcement, which contains instructions for those who want to start using the new front domain.</p>

<p>Sebastian Hahn <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034898.html">announced</a> that gabelmoo, the Tor directory authority which he administers, has moved to a new IP address. “You should not notice any kind of disturbance from this, and everything should continue to work as normal.”</p>

<p>Released in December 2013, the SafePlug is a $49 router that promises its users “complete security and anonymity” online by sending all of their traffic through Tor. Annie Edmundson from Princeton University released a <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/annee/security-audit-of-safeplug-tor-in-a-box/">summary</a> of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci14/foci14-edmundson.pdf">research presented during FOCI’14</a> in which the authors point out several security problems in the implementation of the SafePlug administration interface, and also highlight other structural issues. “The most crucial problem with a torifying proxy is that it uses a bring-your-own-browser system, as opposed to a hardened browser, and therefore is susceptible to browser-based privacy leaks. This is why it’s better to use the Tor Browser Bundle […]”, wrote Annie.</p>

<p>The upcoming Tor Messenger is based on <a href="http://instantbird.com/">Instantbird</a>. One key feature that was identified as missing in the latter is support for <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/">Off-the-Record encryption</a>. After months of discussions and reviews to determine the right programming interface, Arlo Breault got the necessary core <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/e2c85d70fda2">modifications</a> <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/florian_queze.net/purple/rev/6550fcf407f0">merged</a>.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine wrote up a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorControlPortWalkthrough-HS">walkthrough</a> of the controller events you might see when accessing Tor hidden services. “In theory the controller events should help you understand how far we got at reaching a hidden service when the connection fails. In practice it’s <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/13206">a bit overwhelming</a>”.</p>

<p>In the first message posted to the recently-created <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/onionoo-announce">onionoo-announce mailing list</a>, Karsten Loesing <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/onionoo-announce/2014/000000.html">explained</a> a minor improvement that should allow Onionoo clients to determine when they need to be upgraded to a new protocol version.</p>

<p>Leiah, whose design work has featured on many of Tor’s company publications, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/13117">posted</a> a mock-up of a possible new look for the Tor blog.</p>

<p>Patrick Schleizer <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034909.html">announced</a> the release of version 9 of Whonix, the anonymous operating system based on Tor, Debian, and security-by-isolation.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>The help desk has been asked how to configure a VPN to prevent a website from learning that a user is using Tor. We consider positioning a VPN between one’s exit node and the destination site to be totally unsafe, and not much more anonymous than using a VPN without Tor. By design, Tor <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#HideExits">allows the destination site to know</a> that a visitor is using Tor. The better solution is to email the website owner and ask them to stop blocking Tor. The longer-term solution is that Tor needs someone willing to coordinate with websites to design <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users">engagement solutions</a> that work for Tor users and for big websites.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Jobiwan has a machine on their network which should act as a SOCKS proxy. When Tor Browser is configured to use this proxy, it complains that <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4173/88">Tor is not working in this browser</a>. However, Jobiwan is able to visit hidden services with these settings, and wants to know why this message is printed and if it is safe to use Tor Browser this way. Do you know a good answer to this question? If so, please share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Andy Smith asks if <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4050/88">slow relays are useful</a> for the Tor network. Roya suggests that a large number of slow relays is better than a small number of fast relays, at least anonymity-wise, because this helps to grow diversity in the network and makes it harder for an attacker to deanonymize users. On the other hand, user194 and Relay Operator write that a slow relay does not provide much benefit for the network. They recommend spending a few dollars more to rent a fast virtual server.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>The tor daemon has a SafeLogging configuration option that removes all potentially sensitive parts of log messages and replaces them with “[scrubbed]”. However, this option does not cover hidden services operated by the tor daemon. Extending this option involves scanning through some code, but Nick says it could be some interesting code; if you’re up to reading and patching some C code and then reading some (hopefully scrubbed) logs, this ticket may be for you. Be sure to post your branch for review on the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/2743">ticket</a>.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-seventh issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the community around Tor, the anonymity network that makes full use of its library card.</p>

<h1>tor 0.2.5.7-rc is out</h1>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034740.html">announced</a> the first release candidate in tor’s 0.2.5.x series. This version “fixes several regressions from earlier in the 0.2.5.x release series, and some long-standing bugs related to ORPort reachability testing and failure to send CREATE cells”; relay operators running it will also receive a warning if they try to configure a hidden service on the same process as their relay, as the public nature of much information about Tor relays <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12908#comment:5">can help identify services running on the same machine</a>. As ever, you can read the full list of improvements and fixes in Nick’s announcement, and download the source code from the Tor Project’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor protects library patrons’ right to privacy</h1>

<p>April Glaser and Alison Macrina <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/radical-librarianship-how-nin.html">published</a> an article for BoingBoing on efforts by Massachusetts librarians to guarantee their patrons’ right to access information without fear of surveillance or censorship. Macrina and her colleagues, in partnership with the ACLU of Massachusetts, have been giving workshops on the use of privacy-preserving technologies to other librarians, and spreading the word about the risk that pervasive surveillance poses to freedom of thought and intellectual inquiry.</p>

<p>As the authors remark, “it’s no secret that libraries are among our most democratic institutions. Libraries provide access to information and protect patrons’ right to explore new ideas, no matter how controversial or subversive […] and protecting unfettered access to information is important whether that research is done using physical books or online search engines. But now it has become common knowledge that governments and corporations are tracking our digital lives, and that surveillance means our right to freely research information is in jeopardy”.</p>

<p>Tor and Tails are a natural fit for any response to this problem, and BoingBoing reports that not only have “multiple Massachusetts libraries […] installed the Tor browser on all of their public PCs” following the workshops, some have even “set up Tor middle relays on their libraries’ networks”.</p>

<p>It would be a shame, however, if these exciting developments were restricted to the state of Massachusetts. If you are a library user concerned about this issue, share the article with your local librarians. If you work in a library, contact the authors of the article at the addresses they provide to find out how you can offer privacy workshops and tools to your own community!</p>

<h1>Hidden service enumeration and how to prevent it</h1>

<p>When a Tor user wants to connect to a hidden service, their client makes a request over the Tor network to a relay acting as a “hidden service directory”, or HSDir. In return, the client receives a hidden service “descriptor” containing the information necessary for a connection to be made, including the set of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services">Introduction Points</a> that the hidden service is currently using.</p>

<p>Hidden services would ideally not be discoverable unless the address is public or has been shared directly, but one of the weaknesses of the current protocol is that hidden service directories know which services they are serving descriptors for; this same shortcoming was an element of the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">“RELAY_EARLY” traffic confirmation attack</a> discovered in July. Although the full set of descriptors is not published to all directories at once — at any given time, <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-spec.txt#l496">six directories</a> are responsible for a service’s descriptor — the list is rotated frequently, so it would not be hard for an adversary to run a relay stable enough to gain the HSDir flag, and harvest hidden service addresses as they are uploaded to it in turn.</p>

<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034751.html">informed</a> the tor-talk mailing list of an experiment designed to detect this enumeration of hidden services: he set up thirty new hidden services, keeping their addresses secret, with each service running a script to report any attempts at access from outside. As the existence of these services was not disclosed to anyone, any requests to the service could only come from a client that had obtained the address from a directory which had previously held the descriptor, possibly “a malicious Tor relay acting as a TorHS directory, with Tor’s code modified to dump from the RAM memory the TorHS list, then harvest them with an http client/script/crawler”. After approximately a month, according to Fabio’s message, a client did indeed try to access one of the “honeypot” services.</p>

<p>Regular readers of Tor Weekly News will <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2013-December/000023.html">know</a> that the hidden service protocol is being fully redesigned, and this “next-generation” proposal already suggests <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt#l571">defenses against this kind of attack</a>, but (as ever) more eyes are needed. If you’re interested, see George Kadianakis’ introduction to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love">issues facing hidden services</a>; those familiar with cryptography in C are welcome to review the discussion of this particular issue on the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/8106">bug tracker</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-September/003773.html">announced</a> version 14.0.8.1 of Orbot, the Tor client for Android. The highlights of this release are an upgrade to tor 0.2.5.7-rc (see above), which solves an issue with the “airplane mode” feature, as well as a number of improvements to do with transparent proxying. Find the full changelog and download links in Nathan’s message.</p>

<p>Juha Nurmi <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ahmia-search-after-gsoc-development">described</a> the current state of ahmia.fi, the search engine for hidden services, following a successful Google Summer of Code project. The post includes notes on the design, content statistics, and plans for future work.</p>

<p>David Fifield called for a volunteer operating a “ <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007482.html">big fast bridge</a>” to take over the running of the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> pluggable transport: “I want to do this both to diffuse trust, so that I don’t run all the infrastructure, and because my bridge is not especially fast and I’m not especially adept at performance tuning”.</p>

<p>David also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007481.html">wondered</a> why the number of FTE users appeared to dip in late August, and explored possible reasons behind the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007480.html">correlation in usage statistics</a> for meek and Flashproxy, whose backends both run on the same bridge. Karsten Loesing <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007483.html">suggested</a> that the latter was because “we’re counting consensuses downloaded from a bridge via any supported transport, and then we’re attributing those downloads to specific transports based on what fraction of IPs connected per transport”.</p>

<p>Tim <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007471.html">reported</a> on progress made towards a “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzzer</a>” for Tor, based on the Tor research framework previously <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007232.html">announced</a> by Gareth Owen, including a draft design for the process and a list of patches against Tor made during development.</p>

<p>Matt Pagan submitted his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000650.html">status report</a> for August, while Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000649.html">SponsorF</a>.</p>

<p>Karsten Loesing <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007469.html">posted</a> the minutes of last week’s Globe/Atlas developer IRC meeting.</p>

	      <p>Tor 0.2.5.7-rc fixes several regressions from earlier in the 0.2.5.x release series, and some long-standing bugs related to ORPort reachability testing and failure to send CREATE cells. It is the first release candidate for the Tor 0.2.5.x series.</p>

<p>The tarball and signature file are currently available from<br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/" title="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">https://www.torproject.org/dist/</a><br>
and packages and bundles will be available soon.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.5.7-rc - 2014-09-11</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (client, startup):</p>

<ul>
<li>Start making circuits as soon as DisabledNetwork is turned off.<br>
When Tor started with DisabledNetwork set, it would correctly<br>
conclude that it shouldn&#39;t build circuits, but it would mistakenly<br>
cache this conclusion, and continue believing it even when<br>
DisableNetwork is set to 0. Fixes the bug introduced by the fix<br>
for bug 11200; bugfix on 0.2.5.4-alpha.</li>
<li>Resume expanding abbreviations for command-line options. The fix<br>
for bug 4647 accidentally removed our hack from bug 586 that<br>
rewrote HashedControlPassword to __HashedControlSessionPassword<br>
when it appears on the commandline (which allowed the user to set<br>
her own HashedControlPassword in the torrc file while the<br>
controller generates a fresh session password for each run). Fixes<br>
bug 12948; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Warn about attempts to run hidden services and relays in the same<br>
process: that&#39;s probably not a good idea. Closes ticket 12908. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (relay):</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid queuing or sending destroy cells for circuit ID zero when we<br>
fail to send a CREATE cell. Fixes bug 12848; bugfix on 0.0.8pre1.<br>
Found and fixed by &quot;cypherpunks&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix ORPort reachability detection on relays running behind a<br>
proxy, by correctly updating the &quot;local&quot; mark on the controlling<br>
channel when changing the address of an or_connection_t after the<br>
handshake. Fixes bug 12160; bugfix on 0.2.4.4-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (bridge):</p>

<ul>
<li>Add an ExtORPortCookieAuthFileGroupReadable option to make the<br>
cookie file for the ExtORPort g+r by default. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (geoip):</p>

<ul>
<li>Update geoip and geoip6 to the August 7 2014 Maxmind GeoLite2<br>
Country database. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (logging):</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the log severity of the &quot;Pluggable transport proxy does not<br>
provide any needed transports and will not be launched.&quot; message,<br>
since Tor Browser includes several ClientTransportPlugin lines in<br>
its torrc-defaults file, leading every Tor Browser user who looks<br>
at her logs to see these notices and wonder if they&#39;re dangerous.<br>
Resolves bug 13124; bugfix on 0.2.5.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Downgrade &quot;Unexpected onionskin length after decryption&quot; warning<br>
to a protocol-warn, since there&#39;s nothing relay operators can do<br>
about a client that sends them a malformed create cell. Resolves<br>
bug 12996; bugfix on 0.0.6rc1.</li>
<li>Log more specific warnings when we get an ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS<br>
cell on a cannibalized or non-OR circuit. Resolves ticket 12997.</li>
<li>When logging information about an EXTEND2 or EXTENDED2 cell, log<br>
their names correctly. Fixes part of bug 12700; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.4.8-alpha.</li>
<li>When logging information about a relay cell whose command we don&#39;t<br>
recognize, log its command as an integer. Fixes part of bug 12700;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.1.10-alpha.</li>
<li>Escape all strings from the directory connection before logging<br>
them. Fixes bug 13071; bugfix on 0.1.1.15. Patch from &quot;teor&quot;. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (controller):</p>

<ul>
<li>Restore the functionality of CookieAuthFileGroupReadable. Fixes<br>
bug 12864; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Actually send TRANSPORT_LAUNCHED and HS_DESC events to<br>
controllers. Fixes bug 13085; bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha. Patch<br>
by &quot;teor&quot;. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (compilation):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix compilation of test.h with MSVC. Patch from Gisle Vanem;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.5.5-alpha.</li>
<li>Make the nmake make files work again. Fixes bug 13081. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.5.1-alpha. Patch from &quot;NewEraCracker&quot;.</li>
<li>In routerlist_assert_ok(), don&#39;t take the address of a<br>
routerinfo&#39;s cache_info member unless that routerinfo is non-NULL.<br>
Fixes bug 13096; bugfix on 0.1.1.9-alpha. Patch by &quot;teor&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix a large number of false positive warnings from the clang<br>
analyzer static analysis tool. This should make real warnings<br>
easier for clang analyzer to find. Patch from &quot;teor&quot;. Closes<br>
ticket 13036. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Distribution (systemd):</p>

<ul>
<li>Verify configuration file via ExecStartPre in the systemd unit<br>
file. Patch from intrigeri; resolves ticket 12730.</li>
<li>Explicitly disable RunAsDaemon in the systemd unit file. Our<br>
current systemd unit uses &quot;Type = simple&quot;, so systemd does not<br>
expect tor to fork. If the user has &quot;RunAsDaemon 1&quot; in their<br>
torrc, then things won&#39;t work as expected. This is e.g. the case<br>
on Debian (and derivatives), since there we pass &quot;--defaults-torrc<br>
/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc&quot; (that contains<br>
&quot;RunAsDaemon 1&quot;) by default. Patch by intrigeri; resolves<br>
ticket 12731. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjust the URLs in the README to refer to the new locations of<br>
several documents on the website. Fixes bug 12830. Patch from<br>
Matt Pagan.</li>
<li>Document &#39;reject6&#39; and &#39;accept6&#39; ExitPolicy entries. Resolves<br>
ticket 12878. </li>
</ul></li>

	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-sixth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for August 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August continued, with reports from  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000643.html">Yawning Angel</a>,  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000644.html">George Kadianakis</a>,  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000646.html">Isis Lovecruft</a>,  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000647.html">Colin C.</a>, and  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000648.html">Griffin Boyce</a>.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò reported on behalf of the  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000645.html">OONI team</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nathan Freitas  <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-September/003752.html">announced</a> the release of Orbot 14.0.8, containing “some fixes for people who like to fiddle with transproxy/iptables settings, which can lead to the device getting into a bad network state”, as well as for “a common freak crash that was occuring on app exit in some cases.” See Nathan’s message for a full changelog and download links.</p>

<p>Mike Perry  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034606.html">asked for comments</a> on his proposal to drop Tor Browser support for Mac OS X 10.6, which is no longer receiving security updates from Apple. This means that the Tor Browser team would only have to distribute standard-sized 64-bit builds for Mac OS X rather than the oversized 32+64-bit set. Users who are unable to upgrade their operating system would still be able to use Tails for their Tor browsing needs.</p>

<p>Hartmut Haase  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034666.html">reported</a> that Tor Browser occasionally fails to open, despite a successful connection being made to the Tor network; several other users confirmed that they are also experiencing this problem. Georg Koppen  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034678.html">suggested</a> that the issue is the one covered by  <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10804">bug ticket #10804</a>: “Solving this is high on the priority list, but alas not as high as getting everything ready for the switch to ESR31.”</p>

<p>Thanks to  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000681.html">Peter Ludikovsky</a> and  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000685.html">goll</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website and software archive!</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000690.html">published</a> the results of a test he ran to answer the question “Why not just use CloudFlare for mirrors of the Tor Project website?”: “The results are that using CloudFlare doesn’t offload the binaries, which are what make up the bulk of traffic on the mirror […] I’ve started to look at CDN providers to see if there are affordable services which can offload the entire site itself.”</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing effort to rescue the Tor blog from rot and ruin caused by broken Drupal code, ultrasandwich <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10022#comment:22">set up</a> an  <a href="http://tor-blog.deadhare.com/">unofficial preview</a> of a possible blog based on the Jekyll static site generator. If you want to contribute to the revamp of the Tor Project website, including the blog, the  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team">www-team mailing list</a> awaits your comments and ideas!</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users want to know if their personal information is safe when they use Tor Browser. Personal accounts are no less secure using Tor Browser than they are using the web without Tor: the problem of authenticating websites and preventing eavesdropping has been addressed outside of the Tor context through HTTPS. That’s why the Tor Browser ships with the  <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS-Everywhere browser extension</a> — for every website you visit, HTTPS-Everywhere checks whether or not that website is known to have an HTTPS version, and if so it connects to the site using HTTPS instead of HTTP. Tor + HTTPS provides full end-to-end encryption when visiting any site that offers its content via HTTPS. Using HTTPS with Tor helps keep users’ web accounts secure.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>If a single human or organization runs more than one relay, they should configure all their relays to be in the same “family”, the goal being to prevent clients from using more than one of these relays in the same circuit. However, the config option used for this, MyFamily, only accepts relay fingerprints that are preceeded by $, unlike most other config options. It would be great if this option accepted fingerprints preceeded by $, as well as without it. Nick Mathewson says this ticket would be pretty easy, so why not give it a try? It does sound like some fun C hacking. Be sure to post your patch to the  <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12093">ticket</a>.</p>

<p>Back in the day, the tor daemon, which is the core of the Tor network, compiled and ran on Windows 98. But that’s history, and aren’t we all glad? Somebody should identify and drop support code for all Windows versions prior to Windows XP. Nick says “this is mainly going to be a matter of identifying cases where we use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to find always-present-functions in always-present DLLs.” If the previous sentence made any sense to you, maybe you’re a good person to help with this! Be sure to comment on the  <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11444">ticket</a> if you have a branch to review.</p>
