        <div class="post-description">
          <p><p>I&#39;ve spent the past few months developing a new build system for the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-30">3.0 series</a> of the Tor Browser Bundle that produces what are called &quot;deterministic builds&quot; -- packages which are byte-for-byte identical no matter who actually builds them, or what hardware they use. This effort was extraordinarily involved, consuming all of my development time for over two months (including several nights and weekends), babysitting builds and fixing differences and issues that arose.</p>

<p>When describing my recent efforts to others, by far the two most common questions I&#39;ve heard are &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; and &quot;How did you do that?&quot;. I&#39;ve decided to answer each question at length in a separate blog post. This blog post attempts to answer the first question: &quot;Why would anyone want a deterministic build process?&quot;</p>

<p>The short answer is: to protect against targeted attacks. Current popular software development practices simply cannot survive targeted attacks of the scale and scope that we are seeing today. In fact, I believe we&#39;re just about to witness the first examples of large scale &quot;watering hole&quot; attacks. This would be malware that attacks the software development and build processes themselves to distribute copies of itself to tens or even hundreds of millions of machines in a single, officially signed, instantaneous update. Deterministic, distributed builds are perhaps the only way we can reliably prevent these types of targeted attacks in the face of the endless stockpiling of weaponized exploits and other &quot;cyberweapons&quot;.</p>

<h1>The Dangerous Pursuit of &quot;Cyberweapons&quot; and &quot;Cyberwar&quot;</h1>

<p>For the past several years, we&#39;ve been seeing a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/10/us-usa-cyberweapons-specialreport-idUSBRE9490EL20130510">steady increase</a> in the weaponization, stockpiling, and the use of software exploits by multiple governments, and by multiple agencies of multiple governments. It would seem that no networked computer is safe from a discovered but undisclosed and already weaponized vulnerability against one or more of its software components -- with each vulnerability being resold an unknown number of times.</p>

<p>Worse still, with <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-real-story-of-stuxnet">Stuxnet and Flame</a>, this stockpile has grown to include weaponized exploits specifically designed to &quot;bridge the air gap&quot; against even non-networked computers. Examples include exploits against software/hardware USB stacks, filesystem drivers, hard drive firmware, and even disconnected Bluetooth and Wifi interfaces. Even if these exploits themselves don&#39;t leak, the fact that they are known to exist (and are known to be deliberately kept secret from manufacturers and developers) means that other parties can begin looking for (or simply re-purchasing) the underlying vulnerabilities themselves, without fear of their disclosure or mitigation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the use of such exploits isn&#39;t limited to attacks against questionable nuclear energy programs by hostile states. The clock is certainly ticking on how long it will be before multiple other intelligence agencies, along with elements of organized crime and &quot;terrorist&quot; groups, have replicated these weapons.</p>

<p>We are essentially risking all of computing (or at least major sectors of the world economy that are dependent on specific software systems) by stockpiling these weapons, as if there would be any possibility of retaliation after a serious cyberattack. Wakeup call: There is not. In fact, the more exploits exist, the higher the risk of the wrong one leaking -- and it really only takes a chain of just a few of the right exploits for this to happen.</p>

<h1>Software Engineering Complexity: The Doomsday Scenario</h1>

<p>The core problem is this: With the number of dependencies present in large software projects, there is no way any amount of global surveillance, network censorship, machine isolation, or firewalling can sufficiently protect the software development process of widely deployed software projects in order to prevent scenarios where malware sneaks into a development dependency through an exploit in combination with code injection, and makes its way into the build process of software that is critical to the function of the world economy.</p>

<p>Such malware could be quite simple: One day, a timer goes off, and any computer running the infected software turns into a brick. In fact, it&#39;s not that hard to destroy a computer via software. Linux distributions have been accidentally tripping on bugs that do it for two decades now. If the right software vector is chosen (for example, a popular piece of software with a rapid release cycle and an auto-updater), a logic bomb that infects the build systems could continuously update the timestamps in the distributed versions of itself to ensure that the infected computers are only destroyed in the event that the attacker actually loses control of the software build infrastructure. If the right systems are chosen, this destruction could mean the disruption of all industrial control or supply chain systems simultaneously, disabling the ability to provide food, water, power, and aid to hundreds of millions of people in a very short amount of time.</p>

<p>The malware could also be more elaborate, especially if the motives are financial as opposed to purely destructive. The ability to universally deploy a backdoor that would allow modification of various aspects of financial transaction processing, stock markets, insurance records, and the supply chain records of various industries would prove tremendously profitable in the right circumstances. Just about all aspects of business are computerized now, and if the computer systems say an event did or didn&#39;t happen, that is the reality. Even short of modification, early access to information about certain events is also valuable -- unreleased earnings data from publicly traded companies being the immediate example.</p>

<p>In this brave new world, without the benefit of anonymity and decentralization to protect single points of failure in the software engineering process from such targeted attacks, I don&#39;t believe it is possible to keep software signing keys secure any more, nor do I believe it is possible to keep even an offline build machine secure from malware injection any more, especially against the types of adversaries that Tor has to contend with.</p>

<p>As someone who regularly discusses software engineering practices with the best and the brightest minds in the computer industry, I can tell you with certainty that even companies that exercise current best practices -- such as keeping their software build machines offline (and even these companies are few and far between) can still end up being infected, due to the existence and proliferation of the air gap bridging exploits mentioned above.</p>

<p>A true air gap is also difficult to achieve even if it could be used to ensure build machine integrity. For example, all of the major Windows web browser vendors employ a Microsoft run-time optimization technique called &quot;Profile Guided Optimization&quot;. This technique requires running an initial compiled binary on a machine to produce a profile output that represents which code paths were executed and which were most expensive. This output is used to transform its code and optimize it further. In the case of browsers, this means that an untrusted, proprietary, and opaque input is derived from non-deterministic network sources (such as the Alexa Top 1000) and transferred to the build machines, to produce executable code that is manipulated and rewritten based on this network-derived, untrusted input, and upon the performance and other characteristics of the specific machine that was used to generate this profile output.</p>

<p>This means that software development has no choice but to evolve beyond the simple models of &quot;Trust our RSA-signed update feed produced from our trusted build machines&quot;, or even companies like Google, Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft are going to end up distributing state-sponsored malware in short order.</p>

<h1>Deterministic Builds: Integrity through Decentralization</h1>

<p>This is where the &quot;why&quot; of deterministic builds finally comes in: in our case, any individual can use our anonymity network to privately download our source code, verify it against public signed, audited, and mirrored git repositories, and reproduce our builds exactly, without being subject to such targeted attacks. If they notice any differences, they can alert the public builders/signers, hopefully using a pseudonym or our anonymous trac account.</p>

<p>This also will eventually allow us to create a number of auxiliary authentication mechanisms for our packages, beyond just trusting a single offline build machine and a single cryptographic key&#39;s integrity. Interesting examples include providing multiple independent cryptographic signatures for packages, listing the package hashes in the Tor consensus, and encoding the package hashes in the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>I believe it is important for Tor to set an example on this point, and I hope that the Linux distributions will follow in making deterministic packaging the norm. Thankfully, due to our close relationship with Debian, after we whispered in a few of the right ears <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds">they have started work</a> on this effort. Don&#39;t despair guys: it won&#39;t take two months for each Linux package. In our case, we had to cross-compile Firefox deterministically for four different target operating system and architecture combinations and fix a number of Firefox-specific build issues, all of which I will describe in the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">second post on the technical details</a>.</p>

          <p><p>Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the fast-paced Tor community.</p>

<h1>New Tor Browser Bundle releases</h1>

<p>Mozilla released <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0.8/releasenotes/">Firefox version 17.0.8esr</a> on August 6th, fixing several release critical bugs. Three days later, the stable, beta and alpha versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were updated, along with Tails
(see below).</p>

<p>The stable 2.3.25-11 and 2.4.15-beta-2 also updates HTTPS Everywhere, PDF.js, NoScript and libpng to their latest version. Both bundles had a localization issue which was fixed in the subsequently <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-02416-rc-packages-and-updated-stable-tor-browser-bundles">released 2.3.25-12 and 2.4.16-beta-1</a>.</p>

<p>Before updating your browser to the latest version, please pause and admire the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads">enhanced download page</a>. Kudos to J.M. Todaro for the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2109#comment:7">design and patches</a> and Andrew for the final integration.</p>

<p>The pluggable transports bundles have also been <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/pluggable-transports-bundles-2415-beta-2-pt1-firefox-1708esr">updated to 2.4.15-beta-2-pt1</a>. Like previously, they contains flash proxy and obfsproxy configured to run by default. Using flash proxy requires a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto">few extra steps</a>, as before.</p>

<p>For more experimental matters, the new 3.0 series has seen the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha3-released">release of alpha3</a>. On top of the previous updates, several other small improvements were made: in the new launcher and build system, in fingerprinting fixes and in a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9195">possible anonymity threat for Windows users</a> coming from cloud anti-virus solutions. This is another opportunity to play with the new build system that should produce byte-to-byte identical results. Please <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/README">have a try</a> and report any discrepancies with Mike Perry’s builds.</p>

<h1>Tails 0.20 has been released</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.20/">32nd release of Tails is out</a>. It fixes several security issues, and all users are <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.19/">advised to upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Among other small bugfixes, minor improvements and translation updates, this release tightens the security around Pidgin — by removing support for protocols other than IRC and XMPP — and restricting access to the ptrace(2) system call for unprivileged users.</p>

<p><a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/">Download</a>, burn, and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_upgrade/">upgrade</a>!</p>

<h1>New release candidate for the 0.2.4 tor branch</h1>

<p>Roger Dingledine announced the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029344.html">release of tor 0.2.4.16-rc</a>, the latest incarnation of the 0.2.4 series. This release include several major and minor bugfixes.</p>

<p>The most important one is probably a crash that can be triggered remotely via badly formatted INTRODUCE1 cells. Roger advises: “Anybody running a hidden service on the experimental 0.2.4.x branch should upgrade”.</p>

<p>Erinn Clark has updated the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-02416-rc-packages-and-updated-stable-tor-browser-bundles">beta version of the Tor Browser Bundle</a> for a wider audience of testers.</p>

<h1>About Tor Browser usability</h1>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-august-7th-2013">Last week events</a> sparked a good amount of discussions on Tor Browser usability. Several discussions on tor-talk and in other places revolved around the idea that “JavaScript should be disabled by default”. scarp wrote a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029266.html">good summary</a> on why it is not so simple: “I understand that JavaScript was enabled globally in the Tor Browser Bundle for usability reasons as well as to prevent browser fingerprinting. […] If the torproject were to disable it by default, that would not ensure that users are protected in the future by similar methods. Sites can be written in a way that if you do not allow JavaScript they simply won’t work at all. If I was writing an exploit I’d do this to frustrate users so hopefully they enable JavaScript and accept my exploit.“ Roger Dingledine also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029364.html">improved</a> the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled">relevant question in Tor FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>One possible solution to satisfy contradicting requirements would be to
add a “ <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9387">security slider</a>” that would allow users to easily trade off
web compatibility over security. The slider would have three or four different positions that would gradually deactivate more and more features of the browser. One has to understand that the “most secure” should probably disable loading of any pictures. This also impacts the Tor Browser anonymity set but this is probably a trade off that can be afforded given the actual size of the Tor Browser user base.</p>

<p>scarp had also pined another big usability problem related to updating: “This exploit wasn’t new. […] Users running the latest Tor Browser Bundle didn’t have any issues as their browsers had been patched. It is inappropriate for a web browser to not be automatically updated.” Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005228.html">recapitulated</a> the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/BundleUpdatePlan">latest plan</a> that was discussed during the last summer dev. meeting to simply build upon Firefox update mechanism. The next step is to do a proper review. Hopefully, given it is “mature and widespread” and has been “proven to update Firefox”, we will not “run screaming for the hills” when looking at the disadvantages.</p>

<p>On a more general level, an <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/364265592112414720">unexpected comment</a> came from Brendan Eich (Mozilla’s chief technology officer) on Twitter: “Maybe we should just adopt, support, and bundle Tor in Firefox...” David Dahl subsequently opened a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=901614">bug report in Mozilla’s tracker</a> to discuss a way forward. Mike Perry <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2013-August/010650.html">commented on a thread on the liberationtech mailing list</a>: “In short, I am excited by this news, and I look forward to improving our communication and cooperation with Mozilla
on this front.”</p>

<h1>Tails 2013 summit</h1>

<p>The Tails team has sent a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/summit_2013/">report on their 2013 development summit</a> for which “a bunch of people spend a dozen days together in July”.</p>

<p>Read the report in full for all the details. Some highlights: task tracking have been <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails">moved to Redmine</a>, <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=112">tasks fit for new contributors</a> has been better identified, progress has been made to <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6015">move Tails to the current Debian stable release</a>, the <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap">roadmap</a> has been updated.</p>

<p>Communication channels are going to change a little bit “to ease involvement of new contributors, to make more workload sharing possible, and to be able to provide better user support”. As a start a new <a href="https://tails.boum.org/support/tails-support/">user support mailing list</a> was created. Subscribe if you have questions or want to help fellow Tails users.</p>

<p>A lot of discussions revolved around “the growth of the project: given the growing number of users and our super-short release cycle, it is a challenge to keep the project sustainable and maintainable in the mid/long term.” Give the current project exposure, the report rightfully concludes: “Tails is living decisive times, so we expect the next year to be pretty interesting. You can perhaps make the difference, so do not hesitate <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/">joining the dance</a>!”.</p>

<h1>Three new proposals</h1>

<p>On Monday, Nick Mathewson robbed everyone of his “I’m a little teapot” <a href="https://twitter.com/nickm_tor/status/365527533627777025">performance</a> by releasing the following three new proposals:</p>

<p><a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/219-expanded-dns.txt">Proposal 219</a> has been written a year ago by Ondrej Mikle. It is currently at draft stage. Its goal is to make Tor support any DNS query type and also support full DNSSEC resolution. The latter is important as it provides “protection against DNS cache-poisoning attacks” but is made tricky given a routine hostname resolution with DNSSEC “can require dozens of round trips across a circuit”.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/220-ecc-id-keys.txt">another draft proposal</a>, Nick Mathewson describes a plan for a smooth transition from the current 1024-bit RSA keys used for router identity and TLS links to <a href="http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/">Ed25519-SHA-512</a> keys. Several small details still have to be ironed out. This proposal does not address hidden service keys. They will have to be addressed in another proposal once an <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/8106">agreement has been reached</a> regarding the best crypto scheme.</p>

<p>Now that the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/216-ntor-handshake.txt">ntor onionskin handshake</a> has been implemented in 0.2.4, we could get better forward secrecy by having clients stop sending CREATE_FAST cells. Nick Mathewson has issued <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/221-stop-using-create-fast.txt">proposal 221</a> to detail the reasons and the implications of such change.</p>

<p>All these proposals are now up for discussions on the tor-dev mailing list.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Jens Kubieziel researched how to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029256.html">get a GnuPG version for Windows</a> in a secure way, something needed for users that would like to properly verify the Tor Browser Bundle signatures on Windows systems.</p>

<p>George Kadianakis wrote on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005231.html">how to deploy your very own pluggable transport</a> explaining what to do before, while and after coding a new pluggable transport. Given they were designed to be “pluggable”, “it should be easy to write new [ones]”. So be sure to read these advices and start experimenting!</p>

<p>A new round of GSoC reports arrived to the tor-dev mailing list: Johannes Fürmann about <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005237.html">EvilGenius</a>, Cristian-Matei Toader about <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005238.html">Tor capabilities</a>, Hareesan about the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005243.html">Steganography Browser Extension</a>, and Kostas Jakeliunas about the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005244.html">searchable metrics archive</a>. All of them seems to be making good progress. Let’s wish them success for the last six weeks!</p>

<p>More reports came from the July 2013 wave: the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000310.html">Tor Help Desk</a> by Runa Sandvik, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000311.html">Moritz Bartl</a>.</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman gave a talk during the US National Network to End Domestic
Violence’s (NNEDV) annual technology summit. His <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-07-30-NNEDV-Presentation.pdf">presentation</a>
covered “a quick overview of Tor, why I’m here talking about domestic
violence and intimate partner abuse, and what we’re doing to help.”. Be

<p>Below is a summary of some frequent questions received at the Tor help desk this past week:</p>

<p>Users are frequently confused by the message they receive from GetTor. Currently the Tor Browser Bundle is too large to send over GetTor, so users instead receive three mirrors with a link to a page with all available translations of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many users email the help desk unsure of what this page means or which package they need.</p>

<p>A number of users asked whether or not they needed to disable JavaScript in the Tor Browser Bundle. While the vulnerability in Firefox does not affect the latest Tor Browser Bundle, disabling JavaScript globally will reduce one’s risk of being affected by future JavaScript exploits. Users were asked to choose for themselves between greater protection inside the browser or a browsing experience with more functionality enabled.</p>

          <p><p>There&#39;s a new <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029344.html">Tor 0.2.4.16-rc</a> out and all packages, including the beta Tor Browser Bundles, have been updated. The stable Tor Browser Bundles have also been updated to fix a bug in the last release which prevented the language packs from working (which resulted in all of the bundles being in English!). We&#39;re very sorry about this.</p>

<p>These bundles contain flash proxy and obfsproxy configured to run by default. If you want to use flash proxy, you will have to take the extra steps listed in the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto">flash proxy howto</a>.</p>

<p>These bundles contain the same hardcoded obfs2 bridge addresses as the previous bundles which may work for some jurisdictions but you are strongly advised to get new bridge addresses from <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org">BridgeDB</a>.</p>

<p>These bundles are signed by David Fifield (0x5CD388E5) with <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/#verify-sig">this fingerprint</a>.</p>

<p>As usual these binaries should be exactly reproducible by anyone with Ubuntu and KVM support (though there are some issues in LXC).
To build your own identical copies of these bundles from source code, check out <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git">the official repository</a> and use git tag <code>tbb-3.0alpha3-release</code> (commit <code>49db54d147bd0bccc26f1d4f859cf9fe97e5f14c</code>).</p>

<p>These instructions should explain things from there. If you notice any differences from the official bundles, I would love to hear about it!</p>
