	      <p>Velkomin to the eighth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>News from the 2014 Winter Developers’ Meeting in Reykjavík</h1>

<p>Since 2010, the Tor Project’s core contributors have tried to meet twice a year to enjoy the pleasure of each other’s company and move projects forward through face-to-face discussions and hacking time. This year, close to forty people attended the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting">2014 winter dev. meeting</a>, which was held in Reykjavík, Iceland.</p>

<p>The team discussed over forty topics ranging from organizational matters to highly technical design decisions. Among the highlights: many sessions were focused on discussing and producing roadmaps — <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/TorBrowserPlan">a mid-term vision for the Tor Browser</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/RoadmapTIMB">a step-by-step plan for the Tor Instant Messaging Bundle</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/BridgeBundles">detailed ideas for new bridge bundles</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/GuardDesign">ways to solve the research problems around guard nodes</a>, and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/TorReleaseProcess">how to plan little-t tor releases</a>.</p>

<p>The meeting also enabled cross-team communication: pluggable transports developers were able to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/PTTBB">discuss integration into the Tor Browser</a> and the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/BridgeProtocolsAndTBB">lifecycle of recommended transports</a>, while the Tor Browser group and the support teams met to see how to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/SupportAndTorBrowserTeamsMeeting">improve communications on both sides</a>. One outcome is a plan to <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10974">remix existing documentation to create the Tor Browser User Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Two days of intense discussion were followed by hands-on sessions which saw their <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/timeline?from=Feb+21%2C+2014&amp;daysback=2&amp;authors=&amp;ticket=on&amp;ticket_details=on&amp;changeset=on&amp;wiki=on&amp;update=Update">fair share of hacking and write-ups</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the minutes are still missing, but there is already plenty to read. Now that the developers have had to stop contemplating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)">Northern Lights</a>, some <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006288.html">discussions</a> are already continuing on the project’s various mailing lists. Stay tuned!</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Karsten Loesing  <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006299.html">announced</a> an IRC meeting to discuss the next steps for the rewrite of Tor Weather, to be held on the OFTC #tor-dev channel on Wednesday 26th February at 18:00 UTC. “Topics include reporting progress made since the last meeting two weeks ago, making plans for the next week, and possibly turning this project into a GSoC project”.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006282.html">announced</a> the start of a weekly Tor developer’s meeting, to be held on the OFTC #tor-dev channel, “for working on the program ‘tor’. (This won’t cover all the other programs developed under the Tor umbrella.)” .</p>

<p>The Tails developers <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-February/004934.html">will be holding</a> their next contributors’ meeting on the OFTC #tails-dev channel at 9pm UTC on March 5th; “everyone interested in contributing to Tails is welcome.” .</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman submitted his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000462.html">monthly status report for January</a>, and also wrote up a report of his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000463.html">involvement in the recent Boston CryptoParty</a>.</p>

<p>Alexander Dietrich <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003942.html">published</a> a multi-instance init script for Tor (“basically the current official init script and torservers.net’s “instances” mechanism frankensteined together”, in Alexander’s words) in response to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003913.html">a recent discussion on tor-relays</a>.</p>

<p>Responding to a message from someone interested in writing a DNS-based pluggable transport, George Kadianakis <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006250.html">suggested</a> several ways in which the existing obfsproxy code could be reworked to accommodate this.</p>

<p>George also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003951.html">recommended</a> that operators of obfs3 or ScrambleSuit bridges install the python-gmpy package on their relays, as it can significantly increase the speed of some cryptographic operations.</p>

<p>Jens Kubieziel <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006260.html">wrote up</a> the results of an attempt to determine whether the recent transition between the TAP and NTor handshake protocols is connected to some users’ reports of hidden service unavailability.</p>

<p>Max Jakob Maass <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032173.html">published</a> the preliminary results of a test in which the RIPE Atlas measurement API was used to retrieve the SSL certificate of torproject.org from as many countries as possible in order to detect attempted attacks or censorship, and wondered whether it might be worth running such a test on a regular basis.</p>

<p>With regard to a coming redesign of the “Volunteers” section on the Tor Project’s website, Moritz Bartl wrote up a list of proposed volunteer categories that was the fruit of a brainstorming session at the Tor developers’ meeting, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032176.html">asked for suggestions</a> of “obvious” missing sections, as well as “acceptably-licensed” graphics that could serve as icons for each category .</p>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032174.html">wrote</a> from the Tor developers’ meeting with a request for help in compiling “<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/UserStories">user stories</a>” on the Tor wiki: that is, stories of the form “a <em>type of Tor user</em> wants to <em>some feature of a Tor app</em> in order to <em>some reason related to security, privacy, etc</em>”. If you have any to add, please write them up on the dedicated wiki page!</p>

<p>Yawning Angel <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006300.html">sent out</a> a draft of a proposal to “extend the SOCKS5 protocol when communicating with pluggable transports to allow passing more per-bridge meta-data to the transport and returning more meaningful connection failure response codes back to Tor”.</p>

<p>Josh Ayers <a href="http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2014-February/000119.html">wrote</a> to the Tor-ramdisk list suggesting possible ways to ensure that sufficient entropy is available to the kernel by the time tor-ramdisk generates its long-term keys.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>A common question the help desk receives is how to respond to the Tor Browser Bundle’s download warning message. The message indicates that the Tor Browser Bundle only routes browser traffic through Tor, not traffic from any other application. For example, a PDF file that connects automatically to a URL will not route its traffic through Tor if the file is opened with an external application. An <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7439">open bug ticket</a> for improving this warning message has more information about the issue.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the <a href="http://redd.it/1y5y49">inked</a> Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor 0.2.5.2-alpha is out</h1>

<p>Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032150.html">announced</a> the second alpha release in the Tor 0.2.5 series. As well as incorporating “all the fixes from 0.2.4.18-rc and 0.2.4.20, like the “poor random number generation” fix and the “building too many circuits” fix”, this release brings with it several new features of its own, among them the forced inclusion of at least one relay capable of the NTor handshake in every three-hop circuit, which should reduce the chance “that we’re building a circuit that’s worth attacking by an adversary who finds breaking 1024-bit crypto doable”, as Roger wrote.</p>

<p>You can read the full changelog in Roger’s announcement, and download the new release from <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">the Tor Project website</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.5.2.1 is released</h1>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-3521-released">new point release of the Tor Browser Bundle was put out</a> on February 15th. A change in how Mozilla tags Firefox releases <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10895">broke the localization</a> of the browser interface. This release restores proper behavior for languages other than English.</p>

<p>Apart from the localization fix and the removal of unneeded libraries from the Windows bundles, no other changes have been made.</p>

<h1>Help draft a proposal for partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation</h1>

<p>The relationship between Tor users and the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia and related projects, is currently not as good as it could be: many Tor users feel they should be able to contribute to Wikipedia anonymously, while many Wikipedia editors are wary of dealing with a tool that could enable untraceable or unblockable vandalism of pages and articles.</p>

<p>As a prelude to resolving this conflict, Lane Rasberry has <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Partnership_between_Wikimedia_community_and_Tor_community">opened a discussion</a> on the Wikimedia Foundation’s IdeaLab, a forum in which ideas can be discussed and debated before being collaboratively developed into full grant proposals. As Lane wrote, “persons using Tor (the anonymity network) should be able to create Wikipedia accounts and contribute to Wikipedia while logged into those accounts. Some technical problems currently disallow this and some social problems prevent the technical problems from being addressed. Anyone with a proposal of what kind of relationship Tor and the Wikimedia movement should have should describe it here.”</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping to resolve this issue, please see the IdeaLab page, and add your comments!</p>

<h1>Only as good as your weakest transport?</h1>

<p>Delton Barnes <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003906.html">pointed out</a> that although the ScrambleSuit pluggable transport protocol includes a certain amount of protection against active probing for bridges by censorship systems like the Chinese “Great Firewall”, bridge operators who run more vulnerable protocols like obfs3 alongside ScrambleSuit may be increasing the risk that censors will discover their relay and block connections to it of any kind.</p>

<p>In reply, Philipp Winter <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003907.html">conceded</a> that although the Chinese censorship system currently seems to block bridges by IP:port tuples, rather than by IP address alone, the mere presence of an easily-discoverable pluggable transport protocol (or a public relay) on a given machine makes it more likely that a censor will be motivated to try and defeat protections such as those offered by ScrambleSuit. “So you are right, only running ScrambleSuit gives your bridge more protection than running other protocols at the same time — at the cost of attracting less users, however”, he concluded.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>The Tails team has published <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_01/">its report for January 2014</a>. A lot is happening in the growing community of Tails developers. Have a look!</p>

<p>Qingping Hou sent out the beginnings of a proposal to increase the speed of connections to Tor Hidden Services by using circuits of only five hops, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006198.html">asked the community for feedback</a>.</p>

<p>Yawning Angel called for help with testing obfsclient, a C++ pluggable transport client, and clarified the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006211.html">next steps in the development process</a>.</p>

<p>David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000338.html">made available a second updated set of the experimental Tor Pluggable Transport Bundle with tor-fw-helper</a>, which fixes several of the errors encountered in the first version.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006230.html">called for help with reviewing proposal 227</a>, which involves “extending the Tor consensus document to include digests of the latest versions of one or more package files, to allow software using Tor to determine its up-to-dateness, and help users verify that they are getting the correct software”.</p>

<p>Efforts to include the FTE protocol in the Tor Pluggable Transport Bundles have taken a step forward, as Kevin P. Dyer <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006223.html">announced</a> the release of a patch including fteproxy that not only works, but also builds deterministically, in keeping with the Tor Project’s focus on <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">build security</a>.</p>

<p>Rusty Bird <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032152.html">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://github.com/rustybird/corridor">corridor</a>, a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway. corridor will turn a Linux system into a router that “allows only connections to Tor relays to pass through (no clearnet leaks!)”. However, unlike transparent proxying solutions, “client computers are themselves responsible for torifying their own traffic.”</p>

<p>One relay operator was looking for an <code>init.d</code> script able to start multiple tor instances. Johannes Fürmann <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003915.html">pointed out</a> that one was <a href="https://github.com/torservers/setup-automation/blob/master/config/initd-tor">available in the torservers.net Git repository</a>.</p>

<p>TorBirdy, the Tor-enabling extension for the Thunderbird mail client, currently disables the automated account configuration system for security reasons. <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/1083">Progress is being made</a> in changing the behavior to make it fit the expectations of Tor users.</p>

<p>Andrea Shepard submitted seven status reports, covering her activity since July 2013 (<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000455.html">July</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000456.html">August</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000457.html">September</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000458.html">October</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000459.html">November</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000460.html">December</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000461.html">January</a>).</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users often ask for help updating their Tor Browser Bundle. Some users download and try to run their new Tor Browser without first closing their current Tor Browser. This causes an error message, since Tor is already running. The Tor Browser Bundle update is not an upgrade that can be applied while Tor Browser is still running. Users must close their current Tor Browser before running their newly downloaded Tor Browser Bundle.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the sixth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tails 0.22.1 is out</h1>

<p>The Tails team cut its 36th release on February 4th. Their Debian-based live operating system continues to provide anonymity by ensuring that all outgoing connections are routed through Tor, and privacy by ensuring that no traces are left without the user’s knowledge.</p>

<p><a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.22.1/">Tails 0.22.1</a> contains <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.22/">security fixes</a> to Firefox, NSS, and Pidgin. It also brings an updated Linux kernel and several fixes for regressions and small issues.</p>

<p>While advertised as a minor version, the new incremental upgrades are a major usability improvement. Previously, upgrading Tails basically meant installing Tails again by downloading the image and putting it on a DVD or a USB stick. Users who store persistent data in their Tails instance then had to use this new medium to upgrade the stick with their data. A tedious process, to say the least. Now, with incremental upgrades, Tails users with USB sticks will be prompted to perform a few clicks, wait, and reboot to get their system up-to-date.</p>

<p>One usability change might surprise long time Tails users: the browser now has to be manually opened when Tor has successfully reached the network.</p>

<p>As always, be sure to <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/">upgrade</a>! Users of Tails 0.22 on USB sticks can do so easily by running the <em>Tails Upgrader</em> application in the <em>Tails</em> menu.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser Bundle 3.5.2 is released</h1>

<p>The Tor Browser team delivers a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-352-released">new Tor Browser Bundle</a>. Version 3.5.2 brings Tor users <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.3">important security fixes from Firefox</a> and contains fixes to the “new identity” feature, window size rounding, and the welcome screen with right-to-left language, among others.</p>

<p>The curious can take a peek at the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/a1bab4013e:/Bundle-Data/Docs/ChangeLog.txt">changelog</a> for more details. Every Tor user is encouraged to upgrade as soon possible. Jump to the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">download page</a>!</p>

<h1>Call to bridge operators to deploy ScrambleSuit</h1>

<p>In the beginning there was Tor. When censors started filtering every known relay address, <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/125-bridges.txt">bridges</a> were invented as a way to access the Tor network through unlisted relays. Deep packet inspection systems then started to filter Tor based on its traffic signature, so <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt">pluggable transports</a> and obfucation protocols were designed in order to prevent bridge detection.</p>

<p>Currently, obfuscation is achieved through “obfs2” and “obfs3”. obfs2 is flawed; it’s detectable by deep packet inspection and is being phased out. obfs3 is unfortunately still vulnerable to active probing attacks. As obfs3 bridges are open to anyone, an attacker who uses a traffic classifier and finds an unclassified connection can figure out if it’s Tor simply by trying to connect through the same destination.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/">ScrambleSuit</a> comes to the rescue. On top of making the traffic harder to recognize by timing or volume characteristics, ScrambleSuit requires a shared secret between the bridge and the client. A censor looking at the connection won’t have this secret, and therefore be unable to connect to the bridge and confirm that it’s Tor.</p>

<p>obfsproxy 0.2.6 was <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/commit/a3b43d475c4172">released last week</a> and adds ScrambleSuit to the set of available pluggable transports. Bridge operators are now <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html">called</a> to update their software and configuration. At least Tor 0.2.5.1-alpha is required. The latest version of obfsproxy can be installed from <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git">source</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obfsproxy">pip</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003894.html">Debian unstable</a>.</p>

<p>There must be a critical mass of bridges before ScrambleSuit is made available to the Tor users who need it, so please help!</p>

<h1>More status reports for January 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January continued. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000446.html">Kevin P Dyer</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000447.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000448.html">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000449.html">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000450.html">Jacob Appelbaum</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000451.html">Arturo Filastò</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000452.html">Isis Lovecruft</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000453.html">Nicolas Vigier</a> all released their reports this week.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine has also sent the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000454.html">report</a> to SponsorF.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Most Tor developers will gather next week in Reykjavík, Iceland for the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting">2014 winter meeting</a>. Expect a drop in activity on the usual communication channels while everyone is busy with face-to-face conversations. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/events/tors-winter-2014-developers-meeting-reykjavik-iceland">upcoming events</a> for activities open to the larger Tor community.</p>

<p>David Fifield is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000324.html">looking for testers</a> for experimental 3.5.2 browser bundles with tor-fw-helper. “tor-fw-helper is a tool that uses UPnP or NAT-PMP to forward a port automatically” — something that <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">flashproxy</a> requires. David is “interested in finding out how likely it is to work”.</p>

<p>David Goulet gave us an <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006172.html">update on the development of Torsocks 2.x</a>. He hopes to perform a “full on release” after the Tor developers meeting.</p>

<p>”The Trying Trusted Tor Traceroutes project is coming closer to the next data review (03/2014)” <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003865.html">wrote</a> Sebastian Urbach. If you are a relay operator, please help find out how Tor performs against network-level attackers. The team now has a <a href="http://datarepo.cs.illinois.edu/relay_scoreboard.html">scoreboard</a> with feedback for the participants.</p>

<p>One relay started to act funny regarding its advertised bandwidth. Roger Dingledine quickly <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032094.html">reported his worries</a> to the tor-talk mailing list. A couple of hours later Hyoung-Kee Choi <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032096.html">accounted</a> that one of the students from his research group had made a mistake while experimenting on the Tor bandwidth scanner. Directory authorities are now restricting its usage in the consensus.</p>

<p>On February 11th, the Tor Project participated on <a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/">The Day We Fight Back</a>, a global day of mobilization against NSA mass surveillance.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Tor supporters are often curious about the legal risks involved in running a Tor relay. The Tor Project is not aware of any country where running Tor is a punishable offense. Running a bridge relay or a non-exit relay is the best way to grow the Tor network without being exposed to additional legal scrutiny. The decision to run an exit relay should be made only after carefully reviewing the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node">best practices</a>. Unlike non-exit and bridge operators, exit relay operators need to be prepared to respond to abuse complaints.</p>

<p>Users continue to express interest in a 64-bit Tor Browser Bundle for Windows. Work to provide this new variant is <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10026">on-going</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>strugee is running a Fast, Running and Valid relay and wonders <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1485/88">when the relay will get the V2Dir flag</a>. weasel answered that relays should “get the V2Dir flag simply by publishing a DirPort”, but that Tor will not always publish a DirPort: the full list can be found in the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/tor-0.2.4.20:/src/or/router.c#l1018">source code</a>.</p>

<p>Ivar noted that the site <a href="https://www.howsmyssl.com/">How’s my SSL</a> thinks that the SSL configuration of the Tor Browser is bad and wondered <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1455/88">how the situation could be improved</a>. Jens Kubieziel explained some settings for about:config and pointed to a <a href="http://kubieziel.de/blog/archives/1564-Using-SSL-securely-in-your-browser.html">more detailed blog post</a>. Sam Whited also pointed out some settings for Firefox and noted that Firefox 27 <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2014/01/fixing-tls-in-firefox/">improved the rating to “probably good”</a> which will help the Tor Browser in the future.</p>

<p>fred set up a relay on a Windows machine where µTorrent is used besides Tor. When Tor is enabled many trackers become unreachable, but come back as soon as the relay is disabled. An <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1243/88">explanation to this behaviour</a> has yet to be found, don’t hesitate to chime in.</p>
