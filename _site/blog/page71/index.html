	      <p>The Tor Browser Bundles have been updated with a bunch of bug fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Important note to Windows users:</strong> in the last release we enabled automatic port selection for Tor and this had very unexpected side effects on many Windows machines. It turns out that there are a number of consumer firewalls that don&#39;t like things connecting on high ports, which was the default. We&#39;re looking into <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3943">smarter</a> <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3948">ways</a> to handle this failure mode, but until we find one, we have reverted the behavior to using the previous static port. We&#39;re very sorry for the huge inconvenience this caused and hope you will find these bundles more bug-free! As ever, if you don&#39;t, please <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/">let us know</a>.

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p><strong>Updated 09/05/2011</strong> : Add link to actual <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch">implementation patch</a> on gitweb</p>

<p>Website fingerprinting is the act of recognizing web traffic through surveillance despite the use of encryption or anonymizing software. The general idea is to leverage the fact that many web sites have specific fixed request patterns and response byte counts that are known beforehand. This information can be used to recognize your web traffic despite attempts at encryption or tunneling. Websites that have an abundance of static content and a fixed request structure tend to be vulnerable to this type of surveillance. Unfortunately, there is enough static content on most websites for this to be the case.</p>

<p><a href="http://guh.nu/projects/ta/safeweb/safeweb.pdf">Early work</a> was quick to determine that simple packet-based encryption schemes (such as wireless and/or VPN encryption) were insufficient to prevent recognition of traffic patterns created by popular websites in the encrypted stream. Later, a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/119060/WebAppSideChannel-final.pdf">small-scale study</a> determined that a lot of information could be extracted from HTTPS streams using these same approaches against specific websites.</p>

<p>Despite these early results, whenever researchers tried naively applying these techniques to Tor-like systems, they failed to come up with publishable results (meaning the attack did not work against Tor), due largely to the fixed 512 byte cell size, as well as the multiplexing of Tor client traffic over a single TLS connection.</p>

<p>However, last month, a group of researchers <a href="http://lorre.uni.lu/%7Eandriy/papers/acmccs-wpes11-fingerprinting.pdf">succeeded in performing this attack</a> where the others had failed. Their success hinged largely on their use of a simplified yet well-chosen feature set for training their classifiers. Where other researchers simply dumped packet sizes and timings into their classifiers and unsurprisingly got poor results against Tor traffic, this group extracted the time, quantity and direction of traffic, and discarded irrelevant control information such as TCP ACKs.</p>

<p>While the research methodology of the attack side of their work is particularly exemplary (certainly the most thorough study in website fingerprinting to date), their results are still likely insufficient to deploy against the network and expect to catch people engaging in single visits of forbidden websites. For such a use case, even their relatively low false positive rate is going to cause a lot of issues when deployed against large quantities of traffic. Concurrent use of multiple AJAX-enabled websites and/or other applications will also frustrate an attacker. Even without concurrent activity, their &quot;open-world&quot; experiment (the most realistic scenario for dragnet surveillance of Tor traffic) shows true positive accuracy of around 55%.</p>

<p>However, repeated observations over long periods of time are likely sufficient to develop certainty. It is also possible that extracting actual application data lengths from Tor TLS headers would add additional accuracy.</p>

<p>Hence, this is a rather nasty attack. It is basically a one-ended version of the age-old end-to-end correlation attack (where an adversary attempts to observe both the entrance to the network and the exits to correlate traffic flows). With the website fingerprinting attack, the adversary only needs to observe a single entry (a bridge, a guard node, or a regional firewall) of the network to begin gathering information about users who use that entry point.</p>

<p>However, because the attack is only one-ended, many defenses that would be useless against the full end-to-end attack can be considered. In the countermeasures section of their paper, the researchers point out that a Firefox addon that simply performs background HTTP requests concurrent to normal user activity was enough to foil their classifier.</p>

<p>We disagree with the background fetch approach because it seems that a slightly more sophisticated attack would train a separate classifier to recognize the background cover traffic and then subtract it before attempting to classify the remainder. In the face of this concern, it seems that the background request defense is not worth the additional network load until it can be further studied in detail.</p>

<p>Instead, we are deploying an <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3914">experimental defense</a> in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-5">today&#39;s Tor Browser Bundle release</a> that is specifically designed to reduce the information available for feature extraction without adding overhead. The defense is to enable <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_pipelining">HTTP pipelining</a>, and to randomize the pipeline size as well as the order of requests. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch">source code to the implementation</a> can be viewed on gitweb.</p>

<p>Since normal, non-randomized pipelining is still off by default to this day in Firefox, we are assuming that the published attack results are against serialized request/response behavior, which provides significantly more feature information to the attacker. In particular, we believe a randomized pipeline will eliminate or reduce the utility of the &#39;Size Marker&#39;, &#39;Number Marker&#39;, &#39;Number of Packets&#39;, and &#39;Occurring Packet Sizes&#39; features on sites that support pipelining, due to the batching of requests and responses of arbitrary sizes. More generally, the randomized pipeline should obscure the request vs response size and request ordering information available to the classifier.</p>

<p>Our hope is that the randomized pipeline defense will therefore increase the duration of observation required to establish certainty that a site is being visited, by lowering the true positive rate and/or raising the false positive rate beyond what the researchers observed.</p>

<p>We do not expect this defense to be foolproof. We create it as a prototype, and request that future research papers do not treat the defense as if it were the final solution against website fingerprinting of Tor traffic. In particular, not all websites support pipelining (in fact, an unknown number may deliberately disable it to reduce load), and even those that do will still leak the initial response size as well as the total response size to the attacker. Pipelining may also be disabled by malicious or simply misconfigured exits.</p>

<p>However, the defense could also be improved. We did not attempt to determine the optimal pipeline size or distribution, and are relying on the research community to tweak these parameters as they evaluate the defense.</p>

<p>We could also take more extreme measures, such as building pipelining support into Tor exit nodes. Perhaps better still, we could deploy an <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/ideas/xxx-using-spdy.txt">HTTP to SPDY translation service at exits</a>. The more efficient request bundling of <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/spdy">SPDY</a> would likely obscure request vs response size information yet further. However, as these translations are potentially fragile as well as labor-intensive to implement and deploy, we are unlikely to take these measures without further feedback from and study by the research community.</p>

<p>Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, defenses could be deployed at the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/protocol-spec.txt">obfsproxy plugin layer</a>. Defenses there would not help against an adversary at the bridge or guard node, but would help against regional firewalls.</p>

<p>We would love to hear feedback from the research community about these approaches, and look forward to hearing more results of future attack and defense work along these and other avenues.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>About an hour ago I was contacted by the Dutch Government with more details about the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">DigiNotar Debacle</a>. It seems that they&#39;re doing a great job keeping on top of things and doing the job that DigiNotar should&#39;ve done in July. They sent a spreadsheet with a list of 531 entries on the currently known bad DigiNotar related certificates.</p>

<p>The list isn&#39;t pretty and I&#39;ve decided that in the interest of defenders everywhere without special connections, I&#39;m going to disclose it. The people that I have spoken with in the Dutch Government agree with this course of action.</p>

<p>This disclosure will absolutely not help any attacker as it does not contain the raw certificates; it is merely metadata about the certificates that were issued. It includes who we should not trust in the future going forward and it shows what is missing at the moment. This is an incomplete list because DigiNotar&#39;s audit trail is incomplete.</p>

<p>This is the list of CA roots that should probably never be trusted again:</p>

<p>DigiNotar Cyber CA
 DigiNotar Extended Validation CA
 DigiNotar Public CA 2025
 DigiNotar Public CA - G2
 Koninklijke Notariele Beroepsorganisatie CA
 Stichting TTP Infos CA</p>

<p>The most egregious certs issued were for *.*.com and *.*.org while certificates for Windows Update and certificates for other hosts are of limited harm by comparison. The attackers also issued certificates in the names of other certificate authorities such as &quot;VeriSign Root CA&quot; and &quot;Thawte Root CA&quot; as we witnessed with <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion">ComodoGate</a>, although we cannot determine whether they succeeded in creating any intermediate CA certs. That&#39;s really saying something about the amount of damage a single compromised CA might inflict with poor security practices and regular internet luck.</p>

<p>Of particular note is this certificate:
CN=*.RamzShekaneBozorg.com,SN=PK000229200006593,OU=Sare Toro Ham Mishkanam,L=Tehran,O=Hameye Ramzaro Mishkanam,C=IR</p>

<p>The text here appears to be be an entry like any other but it is infact a calling card from a Farsi speaker. RamzShekaneBozorg.com is not a valid domain as of this writing.</p>

<p>Thanks to an anonymous Farsi speaker, I now understand that the above certificate is actually a comment to anyone who bothers to read between the lines:
&quot;RamzShekaneBozorg&quot; is &quot;great cracker&quot;
&quot;Hameyeh Ramzaro Mishkanam&quot; translates to &quot;I will crack all encryption&quot;
&quot;Sare Toro Ham Mishkanam&quot; translates to &quot;i hate/break your head&quot;</p>

<p>Without any further delay, I&#39;ve uploaded <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/rogue-certs-2011-09-04.xlsx">the original spreadsheet</a> and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/rogue-certs-2011-09-04.csv">a CSV text file</a> for people who don&#39;t trust spreadsheets. The information contained in both files should be the same. Hopefully this information will help people to mitigate certain harm from the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">DigiNotar Debacle</a>.</p>

	      <p>We have updated the stable Tor Browser Bundles to Firefox 6.</p>

<p><strong>There are no longer any stable Tor Browser Bundles with the 3.6.x series of Firefox.</strong> We were using pre-built binaries on some platforms and owing to the recent <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">DigiNotar debacle</a>, we no longer felt comfortable shipping versions of Firefox that we were unable to patch. We build all Firefox 6 binaries from source, with our own <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/tree/refs/heads/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches">set of patches</a>, including some <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/commit/0be3b043afa0e54d207f603a3bf3716f6165caa1">specific to the DigiNotar issue</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;d originally planned to drop support for Firefox 3.6 bundles on September 10th, but this moved up the date a bit. The new Tor Browser Bundles are much more feature-rich than the previous bundles, but users may still experience unexpected behavior. Please report all bugs to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/" title="https://trac.torproject.org/">https://trac.torproject.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Windows users will see the biggest difference between the old stable bundle and the new stable bundle. In addition to upgrading Firefox, it includes the latest stable release of <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02232-released">Tor 0.2.2.32</a>, <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-0214-out">Vidalia 0.2.14</a> and <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbutton-141-released">Torbutton 1.4.1</a>. These three upgrades together allow you to run the Tor Browser Bundle at the same time as a system Tor, or even multiple copies of the Tor Browser Bundle in different directories, by <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2264">dynamically choosing available ports</a>.</p>
