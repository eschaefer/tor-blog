            <h2>On recent and upcoming developments in Pluggable Transports</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>this is a brief post on recent and upcoming developments of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en">Pluggable Transport</a> world:</p>

<h1>What has happened</h1>

<p>Here is what has been keeping us busy during the past few months:</p>

<h2>TBB 3.6</h2>

<p>As many of you know, the TBB team recently released the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle 3.6</a> that features built-in PT support. This is great and has taken PT usage to <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-transport&amp;start=2014-03-17&amp;end=2014-06-15&amp;transport=obfs3#userstats-bridge-transport">new levels</a>. Maaad props to the TBB team for all their work.</p>

<p>TBB-3.6 includes obfs3 and FTE by default. If the built-in bridges are blocked for you (this is the case at least in China), try getting some more bridges from <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org">BridgeDB</a> (which also got renovated recently).</p>

<h2>obfs2 deprecation</h2>

<p>We are in the process of <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10314">deprecating</a> the obfs2 pluggable transport.</p>

<p>This is because China blocks it using active probing, and because obfs3 is stictly better than obfs2. obfs3 can also be blocked using active probing, but China hasn&#39;t implemented this yet (at least as far as we know). The new upcoming line of PTs (like scramblesuit and obfs4) should be able to defend more effectively against active probing.</p>

<h2>Outgoing proxies and Pluggable Transports</h2>

<p>Yawning Angel et al. recently implemented <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/232-pluggable-transports-through-proxy.txt">outgoing proxy support for PTs</a>. This means that soon our PTs will be able to connect to an outgoing proxy using the Socks5Proxy torrc option (or the corresponding proxy field in TBB).</p>

<h2>A Childs Garden Of Pluggable Transports</h2>

<p>David Fifield created <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports">refreshing visualizations of Pluggable Transports</a>. Take a look; it might help you understand what these damned things are doing.</p>

<h1>What will happen</h1>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look into the short-term future (a few months ahead) of Pluggable Transports:</p>

<h2>obfs4 and ScrambleSuit</h2>

<p>Remember <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html">ScrambleSuit</a>? Guess what; we are thinking of <strong>not</strong> deploying it after all...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, ScrambleSuit is great, but during the past two months Yawning has been developing a new transport called <a href="https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4">&#39;obfs4&#39;</a>. obfs4 is like ScrambleSuit (with regards to features and threat model), but it&#39;s faster and autofixes some of the open issues with scramblesuit ( <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10887">#10887</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11271">#11271</a>, ...).</p>

<p>Since scramblesuit has not been entirely deployed yet, we thought that it would be a good idea to deploy obfs4 instead, and keep scramblesuit around as an emergency PT.</p>

<h2>Meek</h2>

<p>Meek is an exciting new transport by David Fifield. You can read all about it here: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s basically a transport that (ab)uses Firefox to do SSL in a way that makes it look like Firefox but underneath it&#39;s actually Tor. Very sneaky, and because it uses third-party services (like Google Appspot, Akamai, etc.) as proxies, the user does not need to input a bridge. Meek just works bridgeless and automagically.</p>

<p>Help us by testing the latest bundles that David made: <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html" title="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html</a></p>

<p>Also, since the <a href="https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2014/jun/google-disrupted-prior-tiananmen-anniversary-mirror-sites-enable-uncensored-access">recent Google block in China</a>, Meek will not work with Google Appspot. However, other third-party services can be used instead of Appspot, so Meek does not lose its effectiveness.</p>

<h2>PTs and IPv6</h2>

<p>PTs are not very good at IPv6 yet. We identified some of <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12138">the</a> <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11211">open</a> <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7961">issues</a> and hopefully we will fix them too.</p>

<hr>

<p>And that&#39;s that for now.</p>

<p>Till next time, enjoy life and give thanks and praises :)</p>
