        <p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.1.7-alpha (released November 8) fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages (and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services, adds better defense against DNS poisoning attacks on exit relays, further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of other issues.<br>
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2008/msg00229.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2008/msg00229.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2008/msg00229.html</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.32 (released November 20) fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages (and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services, further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of other issues.<br>
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Dec-2008/msg00000.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Dec-2008/msg00000.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/Dec-2008/msg00000.html</a></p>

<p>Vidalia 0.1.10 (released November 2) fixes some presentation bugs and some bugs in the Windows installer.<br>
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.10/CHANGELOG" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.10/CHANGELOG">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.10/CHAN...</a></p>

<p>In the Vidalia 0.1.10 stable release:<br>
 - Add a prettier dialog for prompting people for their control port password that also includes a checkbox for whether the user wants Vidalia to remember the entered password, a Help button, and a Reset button (Windows only).<br>
 - Fix a crash bug that occurred when the user clicks &#39;Clear&#39; in the message log toolbar followed by &#39;Save All&#39;.<br>
 - Uncheck the Torbutton options by default in the Windows bundle installer if Firefox is not installed.<br>
 - Add a Windows bundle installer page that warns the user that they should install Firefox, if it looks like they haven&#39;t already done so.</p>

<p>Security fixes in the Tor 0.2.1.7-alpha release:<br>
 - The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.<br>
 - The &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; config options did not clear the supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The &quot;User&quot; option is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified user&#39;s primary group. The &quot;Group&quot; option is now ignored. For more detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848.</p>

<p><strong>Design Work</strong><br>
We have a preliminary proposal that suggests we use only one destination port per circuit. This came out of a discussion between Roger and Robert Hogan about how making an AIM connection through your circuit, and then also web browsing through it, can link the web browsing to your AIM login and you may not want that.<br>
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-separate-streams-by-port.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-separate-streams-by-port.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-se...</a></p>

<p>We picked up the &quot;proposal 141, clients do less directory downloading&quot; design discussion again:<br>

 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Nov-2008/msg00007.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Nov-2008/msg00007.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Nov-2008/msg00007.html</a><br>
It looks like we have a plausible new direction to go, but nobody to write up the design proposal or implement it. I&#39;m going to do the first go at the next design proposal in January, and hopefully somebody will have time to build it from there.</p>

<p>We continued extensive work on Thandy this month.</p>

<p>We have a Thandy repository up at<br>
 <a href="http://updates.torproject.org/thandy/" title="http://updates.torproject.org/thandy/">http://updates.torproject.org/thandy/</a><br>
and its keys and location ship with the thandy client.</p>

<p>(The current repository is still for testing only, and we&#39;ll discard the keys and generate new ones when we want to put it up for real. We&#39;ll also get an ssl cert for it.)</p>

<p>The client-side of Thandy (teaching it how to decide which packages and bundles are out of date, and teaching it to download new files and check all the right signatures) exists now too. It supports download resuming, doing the download over Tor, etc.</p>

<p>The big picture is that thandy will remember what versions of each package and bundle are installed. Vidalia will periodically launch thandy-client so it can check for updates. When there are new packages, thandy will tell Vidalia (via stdout currently, since Vidalia launched it). Then when the time is right, Vidalia will launch thandy-client with a --install option, and thandy will know how to run the installers for each type of package (currently &quot;rpm&quot;, &quot;win32&quot;, and &quot;none&quot; are supported):<br>
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/interface.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/interface.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/interface.txt</a></p>

<p>The long-term plan is to have every platform have a package system that is capable of answering &quot;What version of the software is installed?&quot; On Windows, that would either be the new MSI installer file we&#39;re working on:<br>
 <a href="https://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/pkg/win32/vidalia.wxs.in" title="https://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/pkg/win32/vidalia.wxs.in">https://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/pkg/win32/vidalia.wxs....</a><br>
or our current NSI installer, with a new registry key patch we&#39;re working on.</p>

<p>If an upgrade attempt fails (due to a broken package, broken system, sudden power loss, etc), thandy will try again the next time you tell it to install. With luck, it will work later, or an upgraded version of the package that _does_ work will come to be, and thandy will fetch and install that one instead.</p>

<p>We&#39;re working on patching our current Windows installer so it knows how to answer what version is installed. Then it will be easier for all the components to work together.</p>

<p>In short: many more components of our auto updater are coming together, but they aren&#39;t all together yet.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve started to think about moving the Tor Browser Bundle from Firefox 2 to Firefox 3. This will mean we should measure new traces. We&#39;ll do it once Torbutton is known to be more stable on Firefox 3, which should happen in early 2009</p>

<p><strong>Translation</strong><br>
We have our translation server up and online:<br>
 <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/" title="https://translation.torproject.org/">https://translation.torproject.org/</a><br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal" title="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal">https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal</a></p>

<p>We now have a Romanian translation.</p>

<p>We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website translations. Our Farsi translation from this summer is slowly becoming obsolete; we should solve that at some point.</p>

        <p><p>We&#39;ve received requests for .sha1 files in addition to .asc for our packages. Starting with 0.2.1.8-alpha, there are now .sha1 files in the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">appropriate dist directories</a>. Displaying them on the download web page is still a bit tricky. The current layout leaves the page even more cluttered with .sha1 links all over it.</p>

<p>When you download a 0.2.1.8-alpha or later package, simply replace &quot;.asc&quot; with &quot;.sha1&quot; to get the hash file.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll then need to either &quot;openssl sha1 {package}&quot; or &quot;sha1sum {package}&quot; to see if the hash you downloaded matches the package you downloaded. Note: replace {package} with the name of the file you downloaded.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

        <p><p>We&#39;ve published our <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf">three-year development roadmap</a>. There are two main goals in publishing this document: first to be more transparent in what we&#39;re doing; and second to ask for help in improving everything related to Tor.</p>

<p>While we don&#39;t expect everyone will read through the roadmap start to finish, the Table of Contents provides a quick overview of the high-level goals. Each high-level goal is fairly independent of another, so you can simply read about the goals that interest you.</p>

<p>And for the first time ever, we&#39;ve created a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release.html.en">press release</a>. This is our attempt to become more press friendly and provide a way for the media to start a conversation with us.</p>

<p>We welcome your comments and feedback!</p>

        <p><p>Aaron and Virgil&#39;s <a href="http://tor2web.com">tor2web</a> site has been picked up by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/12/tor-anonymized.html">Wired&#39;s 27bstroke6 blog</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081215-tor2web-brings-anonymous-tor-sites-to-the-regular-web.html">Ars Technica</a>.</p>

<p>First off, I think it&#39;s a neat implementation of allowing non-Tor users access to the realm of .onion, aka hidden services. While I think using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/">Tor Browser Bundle</a> is incredibly easy, not everyone agrees with me. Neither Tor nor tor2web host any of the hidden service content. We don&#39;t know who does, nor who runs the hidden service. This brings me to my next thought.</p>

<p>Part of the challenge is that right now there is usually some place in the world that will publish your thing for you if it&#39;s interesting. Wikileaks is this year&#39;s example. But down the road, it may become the case that some things are just too hot for a public site to touch, and besides not everybody can convince Wikileaks to put up their document. Remember Usenet in the 80s? Remember BBSes? Remember NCSA Mosaic and the web in the early &#39;90s? Technical people gravitated to these technologies first. The content reflected the people running the nodes; and the size of the community. People post things just because they can. Teenagers continue to post their plans for world domination; I&#39;ve read them on BBSes, usenet, .plan files, and their web pages over the decades. Why should hidden services be any different?</p>

<p>Hidden Services are fairly new. They can be slow. They are a work in progress, but we believe them to be very secure and anonymous. They are an example of an application that can run on top of an anonymized network layer, such as Tor. Much like any new technology, the userbase is probably small. Sure, all Tor users have access to them, but it takes a lot of motivation and skill to setup a website correctly for hidden services. There are lots of ways to do it wrong and expose where the hidden service runs on the public Internet. This leads to less useful content generated for the masses. Make it easier, and perhaps the users will come in droves.</p>

<p>A few thoughts about potential services, merely copying from the current public Internet now;</p>

<ul>
<li>anonymous blogging (think wordpress, movable type, blogspot)</li>
<li>anonymous microblogging (aka twitter)</li>
<li>anonymous forums for dissidents, abuse survivors, cancer survivors, human rights activists</li>
<li>anonymous dropbox or other personal document sharing (for stuff you just want to access when remote)</li>
<li>anonymous instant messaging</li>
</ul>

<p>Why couldn&#39;t twitter, wordpress/MT/Blogspot, and forum providers setup a hidden service to their current offerings? Wikileaks and IndyMedia do already. If your customers are on a heavily censored Internet connection, hidden services may be the only way they can access your service. Some of these suggestions exist today, but they suffer from the lack of &quot;network effect&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a lot of potential for hidden services to be valuable and host great content. Don&#39;t judge them by the little known content that exists today.</p>

<p>Hidden services aren&#39;t limited to websites either. I use them heavily for anonymous ssh access and getting access to my file systems behind NAT and firewalls.</p>

<p>Be aware that if tor2web logs IP addresses, they have yours; I don&#39;t believe they do log, however. I wonder if Google, Yahoo, and others will crawl tor2web and start indexing the content.</p>

<p>P.S. Wired, we&#39;re torproject.org, not tor.eff.org anymore.</p>

        <p><p>Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha fixes some crash bugs in earlier alpha releases,<br>
builds better on unusual platforms like Solaris and old OS X, and fixes<br>
a variety of other issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.8-alpha - 2008-12-08<br>
<strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New DirPortFrontPage option that takes an html file and publishes<br>
it as &quot;/&quot; on the DirPort. Now relay operators can provide a<br>
disclaimer without needing to set up a separate webserver. There&#39;s<br>
a sample disclaimer in contrib/tor-exit-notice.html.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Security fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When the client is choosing entry guards, now it selects at most<br>
one guard from a given relay family. Otherwise we could end up with<br>
all of our entry points into the network run by the same operator.<br>
Suggested by Camilo Viecco. Fix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process<br>
at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Fix a possible segfault when establishing an exit connection. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Get file locking working on win32. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha. Fixes<br>
bug 859.</li>
<li>Made Tor a little less aggressive about deleting expired<br>
certificates. Partial fix for bug 854.</li>
<li>Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on<br>
sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fix for bug 862.</li>
<li>Fix a crash bug when changing EntryNodes from the controller. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.1.6-alpha. Fix for bug 867. Patched by Sebastian.</li>
<li>Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.8-beta.</li>
<li>If one win32 nameserver fails to get added, continue adding the<br>
rest, and don&#39;t automatically fail.</li>
<li>Use fcntl() for locking when flock() is not available. Should fix<br>
compilation on Solaris. Should fix Bug 873. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Do not mark smartlist_bsearch_idx() function as ATTR_PURE. This bug<br>
could make gcc generate non-functional binary search code. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>Build correctly on platforms without socklen_t.</li>
<li>Avoid potential crash on internal error during signature collection.<br>
Fixes bug 864. Patch from rovv.</li>
<li>Do not use C&#39;s stdio library for writing to log files. This will<br>
improve logging performance by a minute amount, and will stop<br>
leaking fds when our disk is full. Fixes bug 861.</li>
<li>Stop erroneous use of O_APPEND in cases where we did not in fact<br>
want to re-seek to the end of a file before every last write().</li>
<li>Correct handling of possible malformed authority signing key<br>
certificates with internal signature types. Fixes bug 880. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix a hard-to-trigger resource leak when logging credential status.<br>
CID 349.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
