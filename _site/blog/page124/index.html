	      <p>A growing number of people want to use Tor in low-bandwidth contexts (e.g. modems or shared Internet cafes in the Middle East) and mobile contexts (start up a Tor client, use it for a short time, and then stop it again). Currently Tor is nearly unusable in these situations, because it spends too many bytes fetching directory info. This post summarizes the steps we&#39;ve taken so far to reduce directory overhead, and explains the steps that are coming next.</p>

<p>First, what do I mean by &quot;directory info&quot;? Part of the Tor design is the _discovery_ component: how clients learn about the available Tor relays, along with their keys, locations, exit policies, and so on. Tor&#39;s solution so far uses a few trusted directory authorities that sign and distribute official lists of the relays that make up the Tor network.</p>

<p><strong>History of v1, v2, v3 dir protocols</strong></p>

<p>Over the years we&#39;ve had several different &quot;directory protocols&quot;, each more bandwidth-friendly than the last, and often providing stronger security properties as well. In Tor&#39;s <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/attic/dir-spec-v1.txt">first directory design</a> (Sept 2002), each authority created its own list of every relay descriptor, as one flat text file. A short summary of relay status at the top of the file told clients which relays were reachable. Every Tor client fetched a copy from an authority every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Tor 0.0.8 (Aug 2004) introduced &quot;directory caches&quot;, where normal relays would fetch a copy of the directory and serve it to others, to take some burden off the authorities. Tor 0.0.9 (Dec 2004) let clients download &quot;running routers&quot; status summaries separately from the main directory, so they could keep more up-to-date on reachability without needing to refetch all the descriptors. It also added zlib-style compression during transfer. At this point everybody fetched the whole directory every hour and the running-routers document every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>There were two big flaws with the v1 directory scheme: a security problem and an overhead problem. The security problem was that even though there were three authorities, you just went with the most recent opinion you could find, so a single evil authority could screw everybody. The overhead problem was that clients were fetching a new directory even when very little of it had changed. In Dec 2004 there were 57 relays and the uncompressed directory was 172KB; but by May 2006 we were up to 749 relays and the full directory was almost 1MB compressed. Even though we&#39;d lowered the period for fetching new copies to 2 hours (20 minutes for caches), this was not good.</p>

<p>We introduced the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/dir-spec-v2.txt">v2 directory design</a> in Tor 0.1.1.20 in May 2006. Each authority now produced its own &quot;network status&quot; document, which listed brief summaries of each relay along with a hash of the current relay descriptor. Clients fetched all the status documents (there were 5 authorities by now) and ignored relays listed by less than half of them. Clients only fetched the relay descriptors they were missing. Once bootstrapped, clients fetched one new status document (round robin) per hour. Peter Palfrader produced a <a href="http://asteria.noreply.org/%7Eweasel/Tor/tor-client-download-stats-longterm-dl.jpg">graph of bandwidth needed to bootstrap and then keep up-to-date over a day</a>.</p>

<p>All of the improvements so far were oriented toward saving bandwidth at the server side: we figured that clients had plenty of bandwidth, and we wanted to avoid overloading the authorities and caches. But if we wanted to add more directory authorities (a majority of 5 is still an uncomfortably small number), bootstrapping clients would have to fetch one more network status for every new authority. By early 2008, each status document listed 2500 relay summaries and came in around 175KB compressed, meaning you needed 875KB of status docs when starting up, and then another megabyte of descriptors after that. And we couldn&#39;t add more authorities without making the problem even worse.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/dir-spec.txt">v3 directory design</a> in Tor 0.2.0.30 (Jul 2008) solved this last problem by having the authorities coordinate and produce an hourly &quot;consensus&quot; network status document, signed by a majority of the six v3 authorities. Now clients only have to fetch one status document.</p>

<p><strong>Next fixes</strong></p>

<p>Based in part on sponsorship by <a href="http://www.nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a> to reduce Tor&#39;s directory overhead, there are two directions we&#39;re exploring now: reducing relay download overhead and reducing consensus networkstatus download overhead.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve cut relay descriptor size by 60% by <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/104-short-descriptors.txt">moving some of the descriptor info to separate &quot;extra-info&quot; descriptors that clients don&#39;t need to fetch</a>, and we&#39;ve cut the consensus size by 40% by <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/138-remove-down-routers-from-consensus.txt">leaving out non-Running relays</a> (since clients won&#39;t fetch descriptors for them anyway).</p>

<p>We spent the second half of 2008 working on a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/141-jit-sd-downloads.txt">much more radical design change</a> where we move all the descriptor components that are used for path selection into the consensus, and then clients would download each relay descriptor &quot;just in time&quot; as part of circuit extension. This design would have two huge benefits: a) clients download zero descriptors at startup, greatly speeding bootstrapping, and b) the total number of relay descriptor downloads would be based on the number of circuits built, regardless of how many relays are in the network.</p>

<p>Alas, we have backed off on this proposal: Karsten Loesing&#39;s work on hidden service performance concluded that the circuit extension is the main performance killer, and our &quot;just in time&quot; download proposal would add more round-trips and complexity into exactly that step. So we have a new plan: we&#39;re still going to move all the path-selection information into the consensus, but then we&#39;re going to put the remaining pieces into a new <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/158-microdescriptors.txt">microdescriptor</a> that will hopefully change at most weekly. That means the initial bootstrap costs will still be there (though the microdescriptor is maybe a third the size of the normal descriptor), but so long as you can keep a disk cache, descriptor maintenance will be reduced to roughly zero. We&#39;re aiming to roll this change out in Tor 0.2.3.x, in late 2010.</p>

<p>We also have plans to further reduce the consensus download overhead. Since the consensus doesn&#39;t actually change that much from one hour to the next, clients should fetch <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/140-consensus-diffs.txt">consensus diffs</a> rather than fetching a whole new consensus. We could expect another 80% reduction in size here. We hope to roll this step out in mid to late 2009. Alas, this goal is stymied by the fact that <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jun-2008/msg00031.html">we haven&#39;t found any small portable BSD-licensed C diff libraries</a>. Anybody know one?</p>

<p>So these two changes together mean an initial bootstrap cost of maybe 100KB+300KB, and then a maintenance cost of maybe 20KB/hour. But actually, once we&#39;ve gotten the maintenance level so low, we should think about updating the consensus more often than once an hour. The goal would be to get relays that change IP addresses back into action as soon as possible -- currently it takes 2 to 4 hours before a new relay (or a relay with a new location) gets noticed by clients. Since <a href="http://freehaven.net/%7Ekarsten/metrics/dirarch-2009-02-11.pdf">one-third of Tor relays run on dynamic IP addresses</a>, bringing that level down to 30 to 60 minutes could mean a lot more network capacity.</p>

<p>Down the road, there are even more radical design changes to consider. One day there will be too many relays for every client to know about all of them, so we will want to partition the network (see Section 4.4 of <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf">Tor&#39;s development roadmap</a>). When we do that, we can bound the amount of directory info that each client has to maintain. Another promising idea is to figure out ways to let clients build paths through the network while requiring less information about each relay. There&#39;s definitely a tradeoff here between centralized coordination (which is easier to design, and can more easily provide good anonymity properties) and scaling to many tens of thousands of relays. But that, as they say, is a story for another time.</p>

Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha (released December 8) fixes some crash bugs in earlier alpha releases, builds better on unusual platforms like Solaris and old OS X, and fixes a variety of other issues.

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.6 (released December 2) and 1.1.7 (released December 12) update Tor to 0.2.1.8-alpha, include a new version of Firefox, and attempt to wrestle with the &quot;AllowMultipleInstances=false&quot; design that could allow us to run Tor Browser Bundle alongside a normal Firefox.

<p>Tor 0.2.1.9-alpha (released December 25) fixes many more bugs, some of them security-related.

<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong>
Security fixes in the Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha release:
 - When the client is choosing entry guards, now it selects at most one guard from a given relay family. Otherwise we could end up with all of our entry points into the network run by the same operator. Suggested by Camilo Viecco. Fix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.
 - The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.
 - The &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; config options did not clear the supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The &quot;User&quot; option is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified user&#39;s primary group. The &quot;Group&quot; option is now ignored. For more detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848.</p>

<p>Performance scalability fixes from the Tor 0.2.1.9-alpha ChangeLog:
 - Clip the MaxCircuitDirtiness config option to a minimum of 10 seconds. Warn the user if lower values are given in the configuration. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc. Patch by Sebastian.
 - Clip the CircuitBuildTimeout to a minimum of 30 seconds. Warn the user if lower values are given in the configuration. Bugfix on 0.1.1.17-rc. Patch by Sebastian.</p>

<p>Relay stability fixes from the Tor 0.2.1.9-alpha ChangeLog:
 - Fix a logic error that would automatically reject all but the first configured DNS server. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Possible fix for part of bug 813/868. Bug spotted by coderman.
 - When we can&#39;t initialize DNS because the network is down, do not automatically stop Tor from starting. Instead, retry failed dns_init() every 10 minutes, and change the exit policy to reject *:* until one succeeds. Fixes bug 691.</p>

<p>Karsten discovered a bug where some directory authorities would take many minutes to send out a network status, because they were rate limiting too low. The short-term fix is to get those authorities to set
 &quot;MaxAdvertisedBandwidth 10 KB&quot;
in their torrc, so they don&#39;t spend as much of their bandwidth relaying ordinary Tor traffic.

We need to consider longer-term solutions too, where clients actually recover more gracefully from this situation.</p>

<p><strong>Advocacy</strong>
We finally made our 3-year development roadmap public:

<p>Jillian York continued blogging for us about the good uses of Tor:

<p>&quot;Australia Addresses Internet Circumvention&quot;, Dec 19

<p>Howcast produced a quick video for the masses on how to circumvent censorship. We were technical consultants for this video. It&#39;s tough to talk about Tor, when the first question you&#39;re trying to answer is &quot;What is a proxy? And why do I care?&quot; Howcast did a great job for a high-level overview of circumvention technologies in four minutes.

<p>Wendy was a panelist at a conference organized by Paul Ohm and others at Colorado U at the beginning of December on law, wiretapping, and research-oriented data collection: &quot;The Law and Ethics of Network Monitoring&quot;:
 <a href="http://www.silicon-flatirons.org/events.php?id=544" title="http://www.silicon-flatirons.org/events.php?id=544">http://www.silicon-flatirons.org/events.php?id=544</a></p>

<p>Roger, Karsten, Sebastian, Steven, Jacob, Mike, Peter, Wendy, Frank, Christian, and others attended the 25C3 conference in Berlin, Dec 27-30.
Roger gave a talk there, similar to the DC08 talk but focusing entirely on &#39;present&#39; and &#39;future&#39;: &quot;Security and anonymity vulnerabilities in Tor: past, present, and future&quot;
 <a href="http://freehaven.net/%7Earma/slides-25c3.pdf" title="http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-25c3.pdf">http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-25c3.pdf</a></p>

<p>There was a workshop after Roger&#39;s talk on Germany and data retention. Sebastian Hahn was really great at representing Tor there, particularly because it was right after Roger&#39;s talk so he missed half of it, and because it was mostly in German. Roger tried to add the points that a) he really still does want to do Tor talks for German law enforcement (we got a few leads), and b) the major German Tor relay busts were in 2006-2007, not 2008, and maybe we&#39;re finally making progress.</p>

<p>Jacob was among the presenters at 25C3 on a talk about how they had managed to forge a root SSL certificate. In short, this meant that they could pretend to be any https site on the Internet, and no browser would complain. Nick wrote up a response explaining how it works and how it can affect Tor users:
&quot;The MD5 certificate collision attack, and what it means for Tor&quot;
 <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/md5-certificate-collision-attack%2C-and-what-it-means-tor" title="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/md5-certificate-collision-attack%2C-and-what-it-means-tor">http://blog.torproject.org/blog/md5-certificate-collision-attack%2C-and-...</a></p>

<p><strong>New features</strong>
New feature from the Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha ChangeLog:
 - New DirPortFrontPage option that takes an html file and publishes it as &quot;/&quot; on the DirPort. Now relay operators can provide a disclaimer without needing to set up a separate webserver. There&#39;s a sample disclaimer in contrib/tor-exit-notice.html.</p>

<p>We continued work on Thandy (our secure updater) this month.</p>

<p>Thandy itself is working smoothly at this point -- it can contact the central repository, check all the keys, look in the registry and compare the currently installed version to the new choices, fetch the right packages, check all the signatures, and launch the install.</p>

<p>We also now have a branch of Vidalia that has the GUI components for our updater in and working. It launches the updater to check for updates periodically, and there&#39;s a &quot;check now&quot; button. It does the update via Tor if Tor is up and running, and via direct connection otherwise.</p>

<p>We had hoped to be able to get away with patching our current .nsi Windows installer, but it turns out that &quot;nsi silent (non-GUI) install&quot; and &quot;Vista&quot; are not compatible concepts: Vista only likes MSI-based silent installs, due to that whole permissions thing that Vista gets so excited about.</p>

<p>So we now have a shiny new wxs-based msi installer for Tor on Windows:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/contrib/tor.wxs.in" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/contrib/tor.wxs.in">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/contrib/tor.wxs.in</a>
with buildbot-style output here:
 <a href="https://data.peertech.org/torbld" title="https://data.peertech.org/torbld">https://data.peertech.org/torbld</a></p>

<p>The new installer has been tested for install, upgrade, repair and removal. But that&#39;s just Tor, and our recommended download bundle contains four components: Tor, Vidalia (the GUI), Torbutton (our Firefox extension), and either Privoxy or Polipo (an http proxy configured to use Tor -- we&#39;re migrating from Privoxy to Polipo).</p>

<p>So, the next step is to work on MSI installer files for the other three, plus a meta-msi file for the bundle. We&#39;re aiming to have a first go of that at the beginning of January. That way we can give a simpler demo of &quot;download this bundle, then it will automatically notice that it should upgrade Tor, and it will fetch the new package and upgrade.&quot;</p>

<p>In other news, Roger had a long chat with Justin Cappos in early December. Justin did his PhD thesis on security of package managers, and is now a post-doc at UW working on (among other things) auto-update frameworks. See the beginning of a thread here:

<p><strong>Translations</strong>
We have our translation server up and online:

<p>We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website translations. Our Farsi translation from this summer is slowly becoming obsolete; we should solve that at some point.</p>
