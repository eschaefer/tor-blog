	      <p>Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Cutting out relays running version 0.2.2.x</h1>

<p>Tor relays running the now ancient Tor 0.2.2.x are scheduled to be <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11149">removed from the consensus</a>. The change has already been merged in the master branch and will be out with the next Tor 0.2.5 alpha.</p>

<p>Even if most relay operators have been warned, the change has not yet been widely announced. But as three directory authorities are already not voting for the deprecated versions, the downtime of two others while cleaning up after the OpenSSL “Heartbleed” issue was sufficient to get these relays removed from the consensus <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=versions&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-23#versions">for a couple of days</a>, as Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004422.html">explained</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually relays running versions prior to 0.2.3.16-alpha might also be removed from the consensus. “I think 0.2.3.16-alpha’s fix of #6033 makes that one a plausible ’not below this one’ cutoff”, Roger writes in the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11149#comment:7">relevant Trac entry</a>.</p>

<p>Relay operators should always make sure to run a <a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/#recommendedversions">recommended Tor version</a>. The <a href="https://weather.torproject.org/subscribe/">Tor Weather service</a> can be used by relay operators to get email notifications if an outdated version is detected.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003436.html">announced</a> the third (and probably final) release candidate for Orbot 13.0.6: “The big improvements in this build are a fix for the disconnected UI/activity (Tor is on, but UI shows off), and improvements to the transparent proxying iptables scripts”.</p>

<p>The Tails developers put out two calls for testing: the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_1.0-rc1/index.en.html">first</a> is for the first release candidate of Tails 1.0; while the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/test_UEFI/index.en.html">second</a> is for UEFI support, which “allows you to start Tails using a USB stick on recent hardware, and especially on Mac”. “Test wildly”, and report any bugs you find!</p>

<p>Andrea Shepard <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004340.html">sent</a> a list of 1777 fingerprints for relays “which have ever turned up as potentially exposed by Heartbleed”. It appears that enough directory authority operators now <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004362.html">reject relays known to be problematic</a>: sssheep <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032762.html">reported</a> that the still-vulnerable section of the network was down to 0.01% of the consensus weight.</p>

<p>Mick <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004414.html">drew attention</a> to the fact that in its current state, <a href="https://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> — the command-line relay status monitor — wrongly advises relay operators to run it with the same user as Tor, in order to access information about the relay’s connections. This is in fact a very bad idea, and a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10702">ticket</a> is already open to address this issue. Lunar <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004412.html">detailed</a> the correct method of doing this, which is also explained in the ticket.</p>

<p>On the tor-relays mailing list, David Stainton <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004373.html">mentioned</a> his <a href="https://github.com/david415/ansible-tor">Tor role</a> for the <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible automation tool</a>. David hoped that “relay operators will find this useful for deploying and maintaining large numbers of Tor relays and bridges”. The documentation specifies that it currently works with Debian and Ubuntu systems, and contains several configuration examples.</p>

<p>David Fifield continued his progress on <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>, a pluggable transport “that routes your traffic through a third-party web service in a way that should be difficult to block”. David sent a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006718.html">call for wider testing</a> of experimental Tor Browser builds and a call for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006719.html">reviews of the code</a>. “There are a lot of components that make up the meek transport […] This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a new transport!”</p>

<p>Ximin Luo <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006689.html">raised</a> several points regarding how “indirect” pluggable transports like <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">flashproxy</a> or meek are currently handled by Tor. Whereas obfs3 or ScrambleSuit connect directly to the specified peer, transforming the data flow along the way, Ximin describes meek and flashproxy as providing “the metaphor of connecting to a global homogeneous service”. The latter being “incompatible with the metaphor of connecting to a specific endpoint”. Solutions on how to make the design, code, and configuration better are up for discussion.</p>

<p>Nicolas Vigier submitted his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000510.html">status report for March</a>.</p>

<p>Philipp Winter <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-papers-foci14-workshop">relayed</a> the call for papers for the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/call-for-papers">4th USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet</a>. The workshop will be held on August 18th, and should bring together the wider community of researchers and practitioners interested in Tor and other ways to study, detect, or circumvent censorship. Papers have to be submitted before May 13th.</p>

<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006723.html">wondered</a> whether anyone had “ever tried to start Tor from a Python application using Ctypes”, making it possible to “sandbox the Python application using AppArmor without enabling any kind of execve() call”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Many people email the Tor Help Desk from behind restrictive university firewalls that require them to connect using a proxy. Often these firewalls, Cyberoam and Fortiguard are two examples, use Deep Packet Inspection and block Tor traffic. Unfortunately Tor Browser users can’t use a proxy to connect to the internet and also use a pluggable transport. The Tor Browser team plans to include this capability in a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/8402">future release</a>.</p>

	      <p>The <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/call-for-papers">4th USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet</a> is calling for papers. The workshop will be held on August 18, 2014 and seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners working on means to study, detect, or circumvent Internet censorship.</p>

<p>Past iterations of the workshop featured a number of great Tor research papers including a proposal for <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/foci11/tech/final_files/Jones.pdf">cloud-based onion routing</a>, our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final12.pdf">OONI design paper</a>, an <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final2.pdf">analysis of how the GFW blocks Tor</a>, a <a href="http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/12390-foci13-winter.pdf">censorship analyzer for Tor</a>, and a <a href="http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/12395-foci13-nowlan.pdf">proposal for latency reduction in Tor circuits</a>.</p>

<p>Given the past success of the FOCI series, we are looking forward to another round of great Tor papers.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>New beta version of Tor Browser 3.6</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-beta-2-released">second beta version of the next major Tor Browser release</a> is out. Version 3.6 main highlight is the seamless integration of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transports</a> in the browser.</p>

<p>The update is important to users already using version 3.6-beta1 as it contains an updated OpenSSL to address potential client-side vectors for <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a> (also known as “Heartbleed”).</p>

<p>The new beta also features “a Turkish language bundle, experimental Javascript hardening options, fixes for pluggable transport issues, and a fix for improper update notification while extracting the bundle over an already existing copy.”</p>

<p>Jump to the release announcement to know more. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-2/">update</a> and report any bug you may find.</p>

<h1>Key rotation at every level</h1>

<p>The “Heartbleed” issue forces system administrators to consider private keys of network-facing applications affected by the bug as compromised. As Tor has no shortage of private keys in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git">its design</a>, a serious number of new keys has to be generated.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004256.html">prompted</a> relay operators to get new identity keys, “especially from the big relays, and we’ll be happier tolerating a couple of bumpy days while the network recovers”. Switching to a new relay identity key means that the relay is <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay">seen as new</a> to the authorities again: they will lose their Guard status and bandwidth measurement. It seems that a number of operators followed the advice, as <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-15#bandwidth">the network lost around 1 Gbit/s of advertised capacity between April 7th and April 10th</a>.</p>

<p>For a brighter future if such massive RSA1024 relay key migration is ever again in order, Nick Mathewson wrote <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/230-rsa1024-relay-id-migration.txt">proposal 230</a>. The proposal describes a mechanism for relays to advertise their old identity to directory authorities and clients.</p>

<p>Directory authorities can currently tie a relay’s nickname to its identity key with the Named flag. That feature proved to be less helpful than it seemed, and can subject its users to impersonation attacks. As relays switch to new identity keys, those who keep the same name will lose their Named flag for the next six months. So now <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004254.html">seems</a> a good time to “throw out the Named and Unnamed flags entirely”. Sebastian Hahn acted on the idea and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006671.html">started a draft proposal</a>.</p>

<p>How should potentially compromised relays which have not switched to a new key be handled? On April 8th, grarpamp <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004259.html">observed</a> that more than 3000 relays had been restarted — hopefully to use the fixed version of OpenSSL. It is unknown how many of those relays have switched to a new key since. Andrea Shepard has been working on a <a href="http://charon.persephoneslair.org/%7Eandrea/private/tor-heartbleed-survey/">survey</a> to identify them. What is known though are relays that are unfortunately still vulnerable. Sina Rabbani has set up a <a href="https://encrypted.redteam.net/bleeding_edges/">visible list for guards and exits</a>. To protect Tor users, directory authority operators have started to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004336.html">reject descriptors for vulnerable relays</a>.</p>

<p>The identity keys for directory authorities are kept offline. But they are used to certify medium-term signing keys. Roger Dingledine’s
 <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006663.html">analysis</a> reports “two (moria1 and urras) of the directory authorities were unaffected by the openssl bug, and seven were affected”.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, five of the seven affected authorities had new signing keys. In the meantime, Nick and Andrea have been busy writing code to <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11464">prevent the old keys from being accepted by Tor clients</a>.</p>

<p>Changing the relay identity keys of the directory authorities has not been done so far “because current clients expect them to be at their current IP:port:fingerprint and would scream in their logs and refuse to connect if the relay identity key changes”. The specification of the missing piece of code to allow a smoother transition has been written by Nick Mathewson in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/231-migrate-authority-rsa1024-ids.txt">proposal 231</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/freenodestaff/status/455425032203022337">hidden service operators are also generating new keys</a>. Unfortunately, this forces every user of the service to update the address in their bookmarks or configuration.</p>

<p>As Roger summarized it: “fun times”.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for March 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of March continued, with submissions from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000505.html">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000507.html">Roger Dingledine</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000508.html">Kelley Misata</a>.</p>

<p>Roger also sent out the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000506.html">report for SponsorF</a>, and the Tails team reported on <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_03/">its progress</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>CVE-2014-0160 prompted Anthony Basile to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032642.html">release version 20140409</a> of Tor-ramdisk. OpenSSL has been updated and so has the kernel. Upgrading is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-April/000390.html">released new browser bundles configured to use the meek</a> transport automatically. These bundles “use a web browser extension to make the HTTPS requests, so that the TLS layer looks like Firefox” — <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006662.html">because it is Firefox</a>. Meek is a promising censorship circumvention solution, so please try them!</p>

<p>The Tails developers <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/and_the_winner_is/">announced</a> that Tchou’s proposal is the winner of the recent Tails logo contest: “in the coming days we will keep on fine-tuning it and integrating it in time for Tails 1.0. So don’t hesitate to comment on it.”</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000504.html">reported on his week in Stockholm</a> for the <a href="https://www.civilrightsdefenders.org/">Civil Rights Defender’s</a> Defender’s Days where he trained activists and “learned more about the situation in Moldova, Transnistria, Burma, Vietnam, and Bahrain”.</p>

<p>Andrew also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000534.html">updated the instructions for mirror operators</a> wishing to have their sites listed on the Tor Project website. Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000536.html">Andreas Reich</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000537.html">Sebastian M. Bobrecki</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000541.html">Jeremy L. Gaddis </a> for running new mirrors!</p>

<p>Arlo Breault <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006661.html">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://github.com/arlolra/bulb">Bulb</a>, a Tor relay web status dashboard. “There’s not much to it yet, but I thought I’d share […] Contributions welcome!”</p>

<p>Alan Shreve <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006657.html">requested</a> feedback on “Shroud”, a proposal for “a new system to provide public hidden services […] whose network location cannot be determined (like Tor hidden services) but are accessible by any client on the internet”.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users often ask for steps they can take to maximize their anonymity while using Tor. Tips for staying anonymous when using Tor are visible on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">download page</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Jack Gundo uses Windows 7 with the built-in firewall and wants to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1882/88">block all traffic except Tor traffic</a>. Guest suggested that on a closed-source system one can never be sure that all traffic really is blocked, so the original poster might be better off using a router which does the job. Another possible solution is PeerBlock, which also allows you to block all traffic from a machine.</p>

<p>Broot uses obfs3 to route OpenVPN traffic and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/693/88">can’t get obfsproxy running</a> because the latest version only implements SOCKS4. Yawning Angel answered that version 0.2.7 of obfsproxy uses SOCKS5 and works with OpenVPN. However there is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006427.html">a bug that needs to be worked around</a>.</p>

	      <p>The Tor Browser Team is proud to announce the second beta in the 3.6 series. Packages are available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-beta">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-2/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release is an important security update over 3.6-beta-1. This release updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g, to address potential client-side vectors for <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a>.</p>

<p>The browser itself does not use OpenSSL, and is not vulnerable to this CVE. However, this release is still considered an important security update, because it is theoretically possible to extract sensitive information from the Tor client sub-process.</p>

<p>This beta also features a Turkish language bundle, experimental Javascript hardening options, fixes for pluggable transport issues, and a fix for improper update notification while extracting the bundle over an already existing copy.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog since 3.6-beta-1:</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>The Heartbleed Bug and Tor</h1>

<p>OpenSSL bug <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a>, also known as the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed bug</a>, “allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software”, potentially enabling the compromise of information including “user names and passwords, instant messages, emails, and business critical documents and communication”. Tor is one of the very many networking programs that use OpenSSL to communicate over the Internet, so within a few hours of the bug’s disclosure Roger Dingledine posted a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">security advisory</a> describing how it affects different areas of the Tor ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032602.html">“The short version is: upgrade your openssl”</a>. Tor Browser users should upgrade as soon as possible to the new <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-354-released">3.5.4 release</a>, which includes OpenSSL 1.0.1g, fixing the vulnerability. “The browser itself does not use OpenSSL…however, this release is still considered an important security update, because it is theoretically possible to extract sensitive information from the Tor client sub-process”, wrote Mike Perry.</p>

<p>Those using a system Tor should upgrade their OpenSSL version and manually restart their Tor process. For relay operators, “best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys”, and for hidden service administrators, “to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience”. Clients, relays, and services using an older version of OpenSSL, including Tails, are not affected by this bug.</p>

<p>For mobile devices, Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003383.html">called for immediate testing</a> of Orbot 13.0.6-beta-3, which not only upgrades OpenSSL but also contains a fix for the transproxy leak <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032503.html">described by Mike Perry</a> two weeks ago, in addition to smaller fixes and improvements from <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003375.html">13.0.6-beta-1</a> and subsequently. You can obtain a copy of the .apk file directly from the Guardian Project’s <a href="https://guardianproject.info/releases/">distribution page</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, “if you need strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet, you might want to stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.” Be sure to read Roger’s post in full for a more detailed explanation if you are unsure what this bug might mean for you.</p>

<h1>A hall of Tor mirrors</h1>

<p>Users the world over are increasingly aware of Tor’s leading reputation as a well-researched and -developed censorship circumvention tool — and, regrettably, so are censorship authorities. Events such as last month’s (short-lived) <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/when-tor-block-not-tor-block">disruption of access to the main Tor Project website</a> from some Turkish internet connections have reaffirmed the need for multiple distribution channels that users can turn to during a censorship event in order to acquire a copy of the Tor Browser, secure their browsing, and beat the censors. One of the simplest ways of ensuring this is to make a copy of the entire website and put it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Recent days have seen the establishment of a large number of new Tor website mirrors, for which thanks must go to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000497.html">Max Jakob Maass</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000499.html">Ahmad Zoughbi</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000500.html">Darren Meyer</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000501.html">Piratenpartei Bayern</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000505.html">Bernd Fix</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000506.html">Florian Walther</a>, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000507.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (on a subdomain formerly housing the Tor Project’s official site), the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000508.html">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000509.html">Caleb Xu</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000510.html">George Kargiotakis</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000512.html">Tobias Markus</a>, as well as to all the mirror operators of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors">longer standing</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to participate in the effort to render blocking of the Tor website even more futile, please see the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/running-a-mirror">instructions for running a mirror</a>, and then come to the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors">tor-mirrors mailing list</a> to notify the community!</p>

<h1>Mission Impossible: Hardening Android for Security and Privacy</h1>

<p>On the Tor Blog, Mike Perry posted <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy">another large and comprehensive hacking guide</a>, this time describing “the installation and configuration of a prototype of a secure, full-featured, Android telecommunications device with full Tor support, individual application firewalling, true cell network baseband isolation, and optional ZRTP encrypted voice and video support.” The walkthrough covers hardware selection and setup, recommended software, Google-free backups, and disabling the built-in microphone of a Nexus 7 tablet (with a screwdriver).</p>

<p>As it stands, following this guide may require a certain level of patience, but as Mike wrote, “it is our hope that this work can be replicated and eventually fully automated, given a good UI, and rolled into a single ROM or ROM addon package for ease of use. Ultimately, there is no reason why this system could not become a full fledged off the shelf product, given proper hardware support and good UI for the more technical bits.”</p>

<p>Mike has already added to and improved parts of the guide following contributions from users in the comments beneath the post. If you would like to work (or already are working) at the cutting-edge of research into mobile device security and usability, take a look at Mike’s suggestions for future work at the bottom of the guide, and please share your ideas with the community.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for March 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of March continued, with submissions from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000497.html">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000499.html">Colin Childs</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000500.html">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000501.html">Michael Schloh von Bennewitz</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000502.html">Philipp Winter</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000503.html">Kevin Dyer</a>.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò reported on behalf of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000496.html">OONI team</a>, while Mike Perry did likewise for the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000498.html">Tor Browser team</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>David Goulet <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006649.html">announced</a> the seventh release candidate for <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torsocks.git">Torsocks 2.0.0</a>, the updated version of the wrapper for safely using network applications with Tor. “Nothing major, fixes and some code refactoring went in”, said David. Please review, test, and report any issues you find.</p>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032574.html">posted</a> a brief analysis of the role played by Orbot in the recent Turkish internet service disruption: “it might be good to think about Turkey’s Twitter block as a “censorship-lite” event, not unlike the UK or Indonesia, and then figure out how we can encourage more adoption.”</p>

<p>Jann Horn <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004199.html">drew attention</a> to a potential issue caused by some Tor relays sending out globally-sequential IP IDs. Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004206.html">linked</a> to an academic paper connected with the same question, while Daniel Bilik <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004207.html">suggested</a> one method of preventing this from happening on FreeBSD. Exactly how significant this issue is (or is not) for the Tor network is very much an open question; further research into which operating systems it affects, and how it might be related to known attacks against anonymity, would be very welcome.</p>

<p>As part of their current <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/bundle/encryption-tools-journalists#donate">campaign to fund usable encryption tools</a> (including Tor) for journalists, the Freedom of the Press Foundation <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa">published</a> a blog post on the “little-known” Tails operating system, featuring quotes from three of the journalists most prominently associated with the recent Snowden disclosures (Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, and Barton Gellman) attesting to the important role Tails has played in their ability to carry out their work. If you’re impressed by what you read, please donate to the campaign — or <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index">become a Tails contributor!</a></p>

<p>Two Tor-affiliated projects — the Open Observatory of Network Interference and Tails — have each submitted a proposal to this year’s <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org">Knight News Challenge</a>. The <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/global-internet-monitoring-project">OONI proposal</a> involves further developing the ooni-probe software suite and deploying it in countries around the world, as well as working on analysis and visualization of the data gathered, in collaboration with the <a href="https://chokepointproject.net/">Chokepoint Project</a>; while <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/improve-tails-to-limit-the-impact-of-security-flaws-isolate-critical-applications-and-provide-same-day-security-updates">Tails’ submission</a> proposes to “improve Tails to limit the impact of security flaws, isolate critical applications, and provide same-day security updates”. Voting is limited to the Knight Foundation’s trustees, but feel free to read each submission and leave your comments for the developers.</p>

<p>Robert <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006627.html">posted</a> a short proposal for “a prototype of a next-generation Tor control interface, aiming to combine the strengths of both the present control protocol and the state-of-the-art libraries”. The idea was originally destined for this year’s GSoC season, but in the end Robert opted instead to “get some feedback and let the idea evolve.”</p>

<p>After the end of the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/logo/">Tails logo contest</a> last week, sajolida <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-April/005390.html">announced</a> that the winner will be declared by April 9th, after a week of voting by the most active Tails contributors.</p>

<p>Following last week’s progress on the Tor website redesign campaign, William Papper <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/www-team/2014-April/000301.html">presented</a> a functioning <a href="http://wpapper.github.io/tor-download-web/">beta version</a> of the new download page that he and a team of contributors have been building. Have a look, and let the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team">www-team list</a> know what works and what doesn’t!</p>

<p>Michael Schloh von Bennewitz began work on a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowser/VMSetup">guide to configuring a virtual machine for building the Tor Browser Bundle</a>, and another to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowser/BuildingWithGitian">building with Gitian</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Tor Browser users often try to set a proxy when they don’t need to. Many users think they can circumvent website bans or get additional security by doing this. Discussion on clarifying the tor-launcher interface is taking place on the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11405">bug tracker</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Tor’s StackExchange did its second site self-evaluation . Users were asked to review ten questions and their respective answers. This should help to improve the site&#39;s overall quality.</p>

<p>The question <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1573/88">“Why does GnuPG show the signature of Erinn Clark as not trusted?”</a> got the best rating. When a user verified the downloaded copy of Tor Browser Bundle, GnuPG showed Erinn’s signature as not-trusted. Jens Kubieziel explained the trust model of GnuPG in his answer, and gapz referred to the <a href="http://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x334.html">handbook</a>.</p>

<p>The following questions need better answers: <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1584/88">“How to validate certificates?”</a>; <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1439/88">“Why does Atlas sometimes show a different IP address from https://check.torproject.org?”</a>; <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1536/88">“Site login does not persist”</a>; and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1587/88">“My Atlas page is blank”</a>.</p>

<p>If you know good answers to these questions, please help the users of Tor StackExchange.</p>
