	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-sixth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for August 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August continued, with reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000643.html">Yawning Angel</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000644.html">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000646.html">Isis Lovecruft</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000647.html">Colin C.</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000648.html">Griffin Boyce</a>.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò reported on behalf of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000645.html">OONI team</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-September/003752.html">announced</a> the release of Orbot 14.0.8, containing “some fixes for people who like to fiddle with transproxy/iptables settings, which can lead to the device getting into a bad network state”, as well as for “a common freak crash that was occuring on app exit in some cases.” See Nathan’s message for a full changelog and download links.</p>

<p>Mike Perry <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034606.html">asked for comments</a> on his proposal to drop Tor Browser support for Mac OS X 10.6, which is no longer receiving security updates from Apple. This means that the Tor Browser team would only have to distribute standard-sized 64-bit builds for Mac OS X rather than the oversized 32+64-bit set. Users who are unable to upgrade their operating system would still be able to use Tails for their Tor browsing needs.</p>

<p>Hartmut Haase <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034666.html">reported</a> that Tor Browser occasionally fails to open, despite a successful connection being made to the Tor network; several other users confirmed that they are also experiencing this problem. Georg Koppen <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034678.html">suggested</a> that the issue is the one covered by <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10804">bug ticket #10804</a>: “Solving this is high on the priority list, but alas not as high as getting everything ready for the switch to ESR31.”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000681.html">Peter Ludikovsky</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000685.html">goll</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website and software archive!</p>

<p>Andrew Lewman <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000690.html">published</a> the results of a test he ran to answer the question “Why not just use CloudFlare for mirrors of the Tor Project website?”: “The results are that using CloudFlare doesn’t offload the binaries, which are what make up the bulk of traffic on the mirror […] I’ve started to look at CDN providers to see if there are affordable services which can offload the entire site itself.”</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing effort to rescue the Tor blog from rot and ruin caused by broken Drupal code, ultrasandwich <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10022#comment:22">set up</a> an <a href="http://tor-blog.deadhare.com/">unofficial preview</a> of a possible blog based on the Jekyll static site generator. If you want to contribute to the revamp of the Tor Project website, including the blog, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team">www-team mailing list</a> awaits your comments and ideas!</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users want to know if their personal information is safe when they use Tor Browser. Personal accounts are no less secure using Tor Browser than they are using the web without Tor: the problem of authenticating websites and preventing eavesdropping has been addressed outside of the Tor context through HTTPS. That’s why the Tor Browser ships with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS-Everywhere browser extension</a> — for every website you visit, HTTPS-Everywhere checks whether or not that website is known to have an HTTPS version, and if so it connects to the site using HTTPS instead of HTTP. Tor + HTTPS provides full end-to-end encryption when visiting any site that offers its content via HTTPS. Using HTTPS with Tor helps keep users’ web accounts secure.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>If a single human or organization runs more than one relay, they should configure all their relays to be in the same “family”, the goal being to prevent clients from using more than one of these relays in the same circuit. However, the config option used for this, MyFamily, only accepts relay fingerprints that are preceeded by \$, unlike most other config options. It would be great if this option accepted fingerprints preceeded by \$, as well as without it. Nick Mathewson says this ticket would be pretty easy, so why not give it a try? It does sound like some fun C hacking. Be sure to post your patch to the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12093">ticket</a>.</p>

<p>Back in the day, the tor daemon, which is the core of the Tor network, compiled and ran on Windows 98. But that’s history, and aren’t we all glad? Somebody should identify and drop support code for all Windows versions prior to Windows XP. Nick says “this is mainly going to be a matter of identifying cases where we use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to find always-present-functions in always-present DLLs.” If the previous sentence made any sense to you, maybe you’re a good person to help with this! Be sure to comment on the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11444">ticket</a> if you have a branch to review.</p>

	      <p>The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) was an excellent opportunity to improve on the Ahmia search engine. With Google&#39;s stipend and friendly mentoring from The Tor Project, I was able to concentrate on development of my search engine project. Thank you all!</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/gsoc">GSoC 2014</a> is over, but I am sticking around to continue developing and maintaining Ahmia.</p>

<p>Here is the current status of ahmia after GSoC development:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ahmia is <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/">open-source search engine software</a> for Tor hidden service websites. You can test the running search engine at <a href="https://ahmia.fi/search/">ahmia.fi</a>.</p>

<p>Building a search engine for anonymous web sites running inside the Tor network is an interesting problem. Tor enables web servers to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services">hide their location</a> and Tor users can connect to these authenticated hidden services while the server and the user both stay anonymous. However, finding web content is hard without a good search engine and therefore a search engine is needed for the Tor network.</p>

<p>Web search engines are needed to navigate and search the web. There were no search engines for searching hidden service web content, so I decided to build a search engine specially for Tor. I registered ahmia.fi and started development on it as a side project in 2010.</p>

<p>This development involved programming and testing web crawlers, thinking of ways to find hidden service addresses (since the protocol does not allow enumeration), learning about the Tor community, and implementing a filtering policy. Moreover, I implemented <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/">an API</a> that empowers other Tor services that publish content to integrate with Ahmia.</p>

<p>As a result, Ahmia is a working search engine that indexes, searches and catalogs content published on Tor Hidden Services. Furthermore, it is an environment to share meaningful statistics, insights and news about the Tor network itself.</p>

<h2>Interesting Summer of Code</h2>

<p>One of my best memories from the summer is the Tor Project&#39;s Summer 2014 Developers meeting that was hosted by Mozilla in Paris, France. I have always admired the people who are working on the Tor Project.</p>

<p>I also loved the coding itself. Finally I had time to improve the Ahmia search engine and its many features. <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/commits/master">I did a lot of work</a> and liked it.</p>

<p>Some journalist were very interested in my work: Carola Frediani asked if I could analyze the content of hidden services. I coded a script that fetches every front page&#39;s HTML, I gathered all the keywords, headers and description texts and made a simple word cloud visualization.</p>

<p><img src="https://ahmia.fi/static/visuals/content.png" alt="Hidden website content visualization."></p>

<p>It is a simple way to glance what is published on the hidden websites.</p>

<p>Carola found this data useful and used it in her presentation at <a href="http://www.sotn.it" title="www.sotn.it">www.sotn.it</a> on June 11th.</p>

<h2>Technical design of ahmia</h2>

<p>The Ahmia web service is written using the Django web framework. As a result, the server-side language is Python. On the client-side, most of the pages are plain HTML. There are some pages that require JavaScript, but the search itself works without client-side JavaScript.</p>

<p>The components of Ahmia are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Django front-end site</li>
<li>  PostgreSQL database for the site</li>
<li>  Custom scripts to download data about hidden services</li>
<li>  Django-Haystack connection to Solr database</li>
<li>  Apache Solr for the crawled data</li>
<li>  OnionBot crawler that gathers data to Solr database</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/master/technical_architecture.png" alt="Technical architecture."></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/README.md">See installation and developing tutorial</a></p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>The full-text search is implemented using Django-Haystack. The search is using crawled website data that is saved to Apache Solr.</p>

<h2>OnionDir</h2>

<p><a href="https://ahmia.fi/address/">OnionDir</a> is a list of known online hidden service addresses. A separate script gathers this list and fetches information fields from the HTML (title, keywords, description etc.). Furthermore, users can freely edit these fields.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also started a convention where hidden service admins can add a file to their website, called <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/descriptionProposal/">description.json</a>, to offer an official description of their site in Ahmia.</p>

<p>As a result, this information is shown in <a href="https://ahmia.fi/address/#/search=Description%20downloaded%20directly%20from%20the%20hidden%20service.">the OnionDir page</a> and over 80 domains are already using this method.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>We are gathering statistics from hidden services. As a result, we can represent and share <a href="https://ahmia.fi/documentation/">meaningful data about hidden services</a> and <a href="https://ahmia.fi/stats/viewer">visualize it</a>.</p>

<p>We are gathering three types of popularity data:</p>

<ol>
<li> Tor2web nodes share their visiting statistics to Ahmia</li>
<li> Number of public WWW backlinks to hidden services</li>
<li> Number of clicks in the search results</li>
</ol>

<p>The click counter tells the total number of clicks on a search result in ahmia.fi</p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>

<p>We have decided to filter any sites related to child porn from our search results. Ahmia is removing everything related to these websites. These websites may not be actual child porn sites. They are rather sites where users can post content (forums, file and image uploads etc.) and as the result there have been, momentarily at least, some suspicious content that has not been moderated in a reasonable period of time. Ahmia.fi does not have the time to monitor these sites carefully and we are banning sites from our public index if we see any evidence of child abuse. Of course, the ban is removed if the site itself contacts us and we review the website to be OK.</p>

<p>In practice, Ahmia calculates the MD5 sums of the banned domains for use as a filtering policy. Moreover, we are sharing this list and Tor2web nodes can use the list to filter out pages.</p>

<p>At the moment, there seems to be 1228 hidden website domains online and 7 of them has been filtered because they are possibly sharing child porn content.</p>

<h2>OnionBot</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/onionbot">OnionBot</a> is a crawler for hidden service websites based on the Scrapy framework. It crawls the Tor network and passes data to the search database. OnionBot requires the Tor software (using Tor2web mode) and Polipo. The results are saved to Apache Solr.</p>

<h2>Apache Solr</h2>

<p>Apache Solr is a popular, open source enterprise search platform. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, and near real-time indexing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/solr/schema.xml">schema.xml</a> file contains all of the details about which fields your documents can contain, and how those fields should be dealt with when adding documents to the index, or when querying those fields.</p>

<h2>Security measures for privacy</h2>

<p>In the software</p>

<ul>
<li>  We do not log any IP addresses, see <a href="https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/apache2">Apache configuration</a></li>
<li>  We are gathering real-time clicks, however, this data is not shown accurately</li>
</ul>

<p>In the host ahmia.fi</p>

<ul>
<li>  Backend servers are run separately and they do not have any knowledge about the end-users</li>
<li>  All servers are hosted in countries with strong privacy laws. For example, Finland and the Netherlands</li>
<li>  Communication between servers is encrypted</li>
<li>  Only a few trustworthy people know the locations of the back-end servers and are able to access them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>GSoC 2014 was fun and productive!</p>

<p>There is a lot more to do. However, I do not have time to do everything myself. Of course, I am coding when I have time and maintaining the search engine.</p>

<p>In addition, I am going to write a scientific article about the implementation.</p>

<p>Is there anyone who would be interested in developing Ahmia.fi?</p>

<p>Is anyone familiar with Solr and would know how to tweak it for full text search?</p>

<p>Furthermore, any kind of help would be most welcome. There are always Linux admin duties, HTML/CSS design, bug fixing, Django development, etc...</p>

	      <h1>Tor Browser 3.6.5</h1>

<p>The fifth pointfix release of the 3.6 series is available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6.5/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release features <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.8">important security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>

<p>This release also features improvements to the canvas image extraction permissions prompt, and will now log offending script urls to the browser console. It also restores the missing RELRO hardening option to the Linux bundles, and disables NTLM and Negotiate HTTP auth (which can leak sensitive information about the computer). To avoid resolution fingerprinting, popups are also opened in new tabs by default.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog for 3.6.5:</p>

<ul>
<li>  All Platforms

<ul>
<li>  Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr</li>
<li>  Update NoScript to 2.6.8.39</li>
<li>  Update HTTPS Everywhere to 4.0.0</li>
<li>  Update Torbutton to 1.6.12.1

<ul>
<li>  Bug 12684: New strings for canvas image extraction message</li>
<li>  Bug 8940: Move RecommendedTBBVersions file to <a href="http://www.torproject.org" title="www.torproject.org">www.torproject.org</a></li>

<li>  Bug 2874: Remove Components.* from content access (regression)</li>
<li>  Bug 9881: Open popups in new tabs by default</li>
</ul></li>
<li>  Linux:

<ul>
<li>  Bug 12103: Adding RELRO hardening back to browser binaries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Tor Browser 4.0-alpha-2</h1>

<p>In addition, we are also releasing the second alpha in the 4.0 series, available for download on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha">extended downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>This release also includes <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.8">important security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>

<p>In addition to including the changes in 3.6.5, this release also is the first Tor Browser release to enable the in-browser Firefox-based updater. This means that if all goes well, 4.0-alpha-2 users will notified of an available update via a notification similar to that in Firefox. You will then be able to download and install it directly via the browser UI. By default, neither the download nor the update will happen automatically, so if you are not feeling adventurous, you need not allow it to update in this way. Even if you are feeling adventurous, you should probably back up your Tor Browser directory before updating.</p>

<p>In addition to the updater, this release should also re-enable the basic hardening features on Windows, including ASLR, DEP, and SSP.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the NoScript behavior in this release has changed. Selecting &quot;Temporarily allow scripts&quot; will now automatically allow all scripts in a page. This was done for usability reasons, to make it easier for novice users to run Tor Browser with scripting disabled most of the time. This will also hopefully make it possible for more people to use the &quot;High Security&quot; setting in our upcoming <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387">Security Slider</a>, which will have Javascript disabled globally via NoScript by default.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog for 4.0-alpha-2:</p>

<ul>
<li>  All Platforms

<ul>
<li>  Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr</li>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.5 and 4.0-alpha-2 are out</h1>

<p>The Tor Browser team put out two new releases of the privacy-preserving web browser. Among the major changes, version 3.6.5 upgrades Firefox to 24.8.0esr, and includes an improved prompt to help users defend against <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/033969.html">HTML5 canvas image fingerprinting</a>, following a <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12684">patch</a> by Isis Lovecruft. Version 4.0-alpha-2 additionally includes the code for the forthcoming Tor Browser auto-updater (switched off by default) and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-September/000458.html">“better hardening for Windows and Linux builds”</a>.</p>

<p>As ever, you can download the new releases along with their signature files from the Tor Project’s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">distribution directory</a>. Please upgrade as soon as you can.</p>

<h1>Tails 1.1.1 is out</h1>

<p>The Tails team <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1.1/">released</a> version 1.1.1 of the Debian- and Tor-based live operating system. As well as upgrading key components like Tor, Iceweasel, and Linux, this release disables I2P by default when Tails is booted, in response to the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13/">vulnerability recently disclosed by Exodus Intelligence</a>. Like Truecrypt, “i2p” must now be specified as a parameter on booting by users who wish to use it.</p>

<p>A number of other security fixes and routine improvements make this an important update for all Tails users. See the full changelog in the team’s announcement, then update from a running copy of Tails 1.1 if you have one, or head to the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/">download page</a> if you don’t.</p>

<h1>Helping Internet services accept anonymous users</h1>

<p>Without a large and diverse network, run by thousands of dedicated volunteers, Tor would be nowhere near as useful or popular as it currently is. Although the current situation might at times seem fragile, there are still many places where it is feasible to host Tor exit nodes.</p>

<p>However, Tor would become much less attractive to users if they found themselves unable to reach or interact with their favorite websites while using it, a situation that is unfortunately growing more common as site administrators and engineers react negatively to instances of abusive Tor traffic by banning anonymous connections outright. Tor users and developers, as well as members of other online communities (such as <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Partnership_between_Wikimedia_community_and_Tor_community">Wikimedia</a>), have tried to address the issue before, but real progress has yet to be made.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine wrote a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users">“call to arms”</a> explaining the problem in detail and exploring possible paths to a solution: “Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections […]. Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help”.</p>

<p>Since the problem involves humans as much as it does machines, anyone working on it will have to be both “technical” but also ”good at activism”. If you fit that description, OTF has expressed interest in funding work on this issue through their <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a>. Please read Roger’s blog post in full for more details.</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for August 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000626.html">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000627.html">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000628.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000629.html">Noel Torres</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000630.html">Kevin P Dyer</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000633.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000635.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000636.html">Arthur D.

<p>Lunar also reported on behalf of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000634.html">help desk</a>, and Mike Perry did the same for the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000642.html">Tor Browser team</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Yawning Angel <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007420.html">released</a> a new set of experimental Tor Browser builds containing the proposed obfs4 pluggable transport, along with a changelog; “questions, comments, feedback” are welcome on the email thread or the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12130">bug ticket</a> tracking the deployment of obfs4.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007450.html">announced</a> the release of version 1.1.0 of oonibackend, the tool “<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oonibackend">used by ooniprobe</a> to discover the addresses of test helpers (via the bouncer) to submit reports to (via the collector) and to perform some measurements that require a backend system to talk to (via test helpers)”.</p>

<p>meejah <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007426.html">posted</a> a list of tasks to be completed in order to bring Tor Weather to a deployable state, following the recent rewrite effort and the Google Summer of Code project by Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi.</p>

<p>Israel Leiva submitted a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007427.html">summary</a> of work completed as part of the “Revamp GetTor” Google Summer of Code project: “The plan for now is to keep doing tests and deploy it asap (hopefully during September).”</p>

<p>Mike Perry <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007417.html">posted</a> an <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/mikeperry/torspec.git/blob/refs/heads/multihop-padding-primitives:/proposals/ideas/xxx-multihop-padding-primitives.txt">updated version</a> of the proposal for website fingerprinting countermeasures which he co-authored with Marc Juarez as part of the latter’s Google Summer of Code project.</p>

<p>Lunar gave a <a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2014/debconf14/webm/Reproducible_Builds_for_Debian_a_year_later.webm">talk</a> at this year’s DebConf on the effort to build Debian packages deterministically, which is inspired in large part by <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">Tor Browser’s use of the same technology</a>. <a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20140901/000198.html">Major progress</a> was achieved during the conference.</p>

<p>David Fifield submitted a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007429.html">breakdown</a> of the costs incurred by the infrastructure that supports the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> pluggable transport since its introduction. The total to date from both the Google App Engine and Amazon AWS front domains? \$6.56.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000653.html">P D</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000673.html">Daniel Pajonzeck</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website and software!</p>

<p>Also on the subject of mirrors, Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000675.html">alerted</a> the tor-mirrors mailing list to the fact that the Tor Project website (specifically the distribution directory) will shortly be increasing in size to eight or nine gigabytes, as a result of the soon-to-be-implemented <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/4234">Tor Browser updater</a>. Mirror operators will need to ensure that they can provide enough disk space to accommodate the change.</p>

<p>whonixqubes <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-August/034562.html">announced</a> the release of an integrated version of the Whonix and Qubes operating systems: “I look forward to helping make Qubes + Whonix integration even tighter and more seamless throughout the future.”</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>The help desk has been asked if Tor can make a website visit appear to come from China. Tor connections appear to originate from the country where the exit relay in use is located; since Tor is blocked in China, there are zero exit relays in China. A visualization of the different country-locations of exit relays can be found on Tor’s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html#country-exits-only">metrics page</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Anony Mouse wanted to know why Facebook shows the location of the user’s last login over Tor as <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3364/88">Baghdad or Dhaka</a>, instead of the real location of the exit relay. qbi posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/qbi/status/506550322308055040">screenshot</a> showing this issue. According to Facebook, this information is based on an approximation, but this approximation locates all Tor exit relays either in Baghdad or in Dhaka.</p>

<p>user3500 <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3961/88">wants to contribute to Tor</a> and asks how this can be done as an inexperienced developer. Jens Kubieziel replied with several possibilities, including reading the volunteer page and Tor Weekly News: in particular, the section containing easy development tasks might be a good start. Roya pointed out that any contribution is better than no contribution, and encouraged user3500 to just get started. Umut Seven recommended writing unit tests.</p>

<p>Kras wants to use FoxyProxy in connection with Tor Browser Bundle and <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3239/88">asks if it is safe to do so</a>. At the moment, there is only an answer saying “yes”, without any explanation. What is your experience? Is it safe for a user to install and use FoxyProxy?</p>
