          <p>For a few years now, funders have been asking if they can pay Tor to run more relays. I kept telling them their money was better spent on code and design improvements:
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow</a>
 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/Performance" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/Performance">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/Performan...</a>
since a) network load would just grow to fill whatever new capacity we have, especially if we don&#39;t deal with the tiny fraction of users who do bulk downloads, and b) reducing diversity of relay operator control can harm anonymity.</p>

<p>But lately the Tor network has become noticeably faster, and I think it has a lot to do with the growing amount of excess relay capacity relative to network load:
 <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2010-06-01&amp;end=2012-07-21#bandwidth" title="https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2010-06-01&amp;end=2012-07-21#bandwidth">https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2010-0...</a></p>

<p>At the same time, much of our performance improvement comes from better load balancing -- that is, concentrating traffic on the relays that can handle it better. The result though is a direct tradeoff with relay diversity: on today&#39;s network, clients choose one of the fastest 5 exit relays around 25-30% of the time, and 80% of their choices come from a pool of 40-50 relays.
 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443</a></p>

<p>Since extra capacity is clearly good for performance, and since we&#39;re not doing particularly well at diversity with the current approach, we&#39;re going to try an experiment: we&#39;ll connect funding to exit relay operators so they can run bigger and/or better exit relays.</p>

<p>If we do it right (make more faster exit relays that aren&#39;t the current biggest ones, so there are more to choose from), we will improve the network&#39;s diversity as well as being able to handle more users.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve lined up our first funder (BBG, aka <a href="http://www.voanews.com/" title="http://www.voanews.com/">http://www.voanews.com/</a>), and they&#39;re excited to have us start as soon as we can. They want to sponsor 125+ fast exits.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started a discussion on the tor-relays list about open questions that we as a community will need to decide about:
1) What exactly would we pay for?
2) Should we fund existing relays or new ones?
4) What exactly do we mean by diversity?
5) How much &quot;should&quot; an exit relay cost?
6) How exactly should we choose which exit relay operators to reimburse?
7) How do we audit / track the sponsored relays?
8) Legal questions?</p>

<p>The first step is collecting facts about the current fast Tor exit relays. Please join the discussion on the tor-relays list if you want to contribute:

          <p>For the past four years, I&#39;ve been summarizing progress of Tor on the blog. See the tag <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/progress-report">progress report</a> for the history of these reports. Based on community feedback, we&#39;re switching to a mailing list with archive of the raw status reports. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/">Tor-reports</a> is live. The goal is to provide the raw details rather than summarizing all of the progress and only being able to provide a quick summary per topic.</p>

<p>Each developer, advocate, and internal staff will be posting their reports to this list. The idea is to share more with the community and give people a chance to ask questions directly of the people doing the work. Enjoy the transparency.</p>

          <p>Thanks to all who attended and helped make the hackfest in Florence a success. Around 50 people stayed for the two day event. We heard from a team working on a free hardware and software (firmware to drivers) laptop prototype, some <a href="http://www.studiogallus.it/">Italian legal experts</a> with regards to anonymity, encryption, and chilling effects used to great length in the country, plus a number of Italian hackers from <a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2012</a> interested in Tor (and vice versa).</p>

<p>And a big thanks to the <a href="http://www.unifi.it/">Università degli Studi di Firenze</a>, <a href="http://www.winstonsmith.org/">Il Progetto Winston Smith</a> and Arturo for their translations, coordinations, and general welcoming attitude to Italy.</p>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Last week, a user in Jordan reported seeing a fake certificate for <a href="https://torproject.org/">torproject.org</a>. The user did not report any errors when browsing to sites such as <a href="https://gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, which suggests that this was a targeted attack. The certificate was issued by a company called <a href="http://www.cyberoam.com/">Cyberoam</a>. We first believed that this incident was similar to that of <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion">Comodo</a> and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">DigiNotar</a>, and that Cyberoam had been tricked to issue a fake certificate for our website.</p>

<p><center>
<br>
<img src="https://media.torproject.org/image/blog-images/2012-07-03-screenshot-cyberoam-cropped.png"><br>
</center></p>

<p>After a bit of research, we learned that Cyberoam <a href="http://www.cyberoamworks.com/">make a range of devices</a> used for Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). The user was not just seeing a fake certificate for torproject.org, his connection was actually being intercepted by one of their devices. While investigating this further, Ben Laurie and I found a security vulnerability affecting all Cyberoam DPI devices.</p>

<p>Examination of a certificate chain generated by a Cyberoam DPI device shows that all such devices share the same CA certificate and hence the same private key. It is therefore possible to intercept traffic from any victim of a Cyberoam device with any other Cyberoam device - or to extract the key from the device and import it into other DPI devices, and use those for interception.</p>

<p>Ben and I wrote a <a href="https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-07-03-cyberoam-CVE-2012-3372.txt">security advisory</a> and notified Cyberoam of this vulnerability at 17:00 UTC on Saturday, June 30. We made it clear that we intended to publish this blog post and the security advisory on Tuesday, July 3, and encouraged them to respond promptly if they had any comments. At the same time, we notified browser vendors and asked that they blacklist the Cyberoam CA certificate in their browsers.</p>

<p>Cyberoam have not yet commented on this issue, apart from acknowledging our first email and saying that they are looking into it. The Cyberoam CA certificate is not trusted, and so browsers will show users a warning (unless someone has already installed the certificate). Users with the Tor Browser Bundle are not affected.</p>

<p>To check if this CA is installed in your browser, see the following instructions for <a href="http://blog.devantis.com/?p=79">Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome</a>, and <a href="http://fairerplatform.com/2011/09/how-to-disable-diginotar-ssl-certificate/">Safari</a>. The instructions mention DigiNotar, but they are still valid. If you have more information about this issue, please email <a href="mailto:help@rt.torproject.org">help@rt.torproject.org</a>.</p>
