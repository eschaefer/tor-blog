          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torprojet.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what&#39;s happening in the world of Tor — <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity">“king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity”</a>.</p>

<h1>New tranche of NSA/GCHQ Tor documents released</h1>

<p>After a cameo appearance in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-nsa-gchq-and-quick-ant-speculation">previous leaked intelligence documents</a>, Tor found itself at the center of attention in the latest installment of the ongoing Snowden disclosures after a series of stories were published in the Guardian and the Washington Post that detailed alleged attempts by NSA, GCHQ, and their allies to defeat or circumvent the protection that Tor offers its users. A number of source materials, redacted by the newspapers, were published to accompany the articles.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://media.encrypted.cc/files/nsa">documents in question</a> offer, alongside characteristically <a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/386291345301581825">entertaining illustrations</a>, an overview of the Tor network from the point of view of the intelligence agencies, as well as a summary of attacks against Tor users and the network as a whole that they have considered or carried out.</p>

<p>Despite the understandable concern provoked among users by these disclosures, Tor developers themselves were encouraged by the often relatively basic or out-of-date nature of the attacks described. In response to one journalist&#39;s request for comment, Roger Dingledine <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/yes-we-know-about-guardian-article#comment-35793">wrote</a> that “we still have a lot of work to do to make Tor both safe and usable, but we don&#39;t have any new work based on these slides”.</p>

<p>Have a look at the documents yourself, and feel free to raise any questions with the community on the mailing lists or IRC channels.</p>

<h1>tor 0.2.5.1-alpha is out</h1>

<p>Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030269.html">announced</a> the first alpha release in the tor 0.2.5.x series, which among many other improvements introduces experimental support for syscall sandboxing on Linux, as well as statistics reporting for pluggable transports usage on compatible bridges.</p>

<p>Roger warned that “this is the first alpha release in a new series, so expect there to be bugs. Users who would rather test out a more stable branch should stay with 0.2.4.x for now.” 0.2.5.1-alpha will not immediately appear on the main download pages, in order to avoid having too many versions listed at once. Please feel free to test the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">new release</a>, and report any bugs you find!</p>

<h1>How did Tor achieve reproducible builds?</h1>

<p>At the end of June, Mike Perry <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released">announced</a> the first release of the Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 alpha series, featuring release binaries “exactly reproducible from the source code by anyone”. In a subsequent <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">blog post</a> published in August, he explained why it mattered.</p>

<p>Mike has just published the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">promised follow-up piece</a> describing how this feat was achieved in the new Tor Browser Bundle build process.</p>

<p>He explains how <a href="http://gitian.org/howto.html">Gitian</a> is used to create a reproducible build environment, the tools used to produce cross-platform binaries for Windows and OS X from a Linux environment, and several issues that prevented the builds from being entirely deterministic. The latter range from timestamps to file ordering differences when looking up a directory, with an added 3 bytes of pure mystery.</p>

<p>There is more work to be done to “prevent the adversary from compromising the (substantially weaker) Ubuntu build and packaging processes” currently used for the toolchain. Mike also wrote about making the build of the compiler and toolchain part of the build process, cross-compilation between multiple architectures, and the work being done by Linux distributions to produce deterministic builds from their packages.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping, or working on your own software project, there is a lot to be learned by reading the blog post in full.</p>

<h1>Toward a new Tor Instant Messaging Bundle</h1>

<p>A first meeting last week kicked-off the “<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/Otter/Attentive">Attentive Otter project</a>” which aims to come up with a new bundle for instant messaging. The first meeting mainly consisted in trying to enumerate the various options.</p>

<p>In the end, people volunteered to research three different implementation ideas. Thijs Alkemade and Jurre van Bergen explored the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005544.html">possibilty of using Pidgin/libpurple</a> as the core component. Jurre also prepared an <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005546.html">analysis of xmpp-client</a>, together with David Goulet, Nick Mathewson, Arlo Breault, and George Kadianakis. As a third option, Mike Perry took a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005555.html">closer look at Instantbird/Thunderbird</a> with Sukhbir Singh.</p>

<p>All the options have their pros and cons, and they will probably be discussed on the tor-dev mailing list and at the next “Attentive Otter” meeting.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for September 2013</h1>

<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>

<p>A number of users wanted to know if Tor was still safe to use given the recent news that Tor users have been targeted by the NSA. We directed these users to the Tor Project&#39;s <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/yes-we-know-about-guardian-article">official statement on the subject</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most popular questions the help desk receives continues to be whether or not Tor is available on iOS devices. Currently there is no officially supported solution, although more than one project has been presented (<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005542.html">1</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8933">2</a>).</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is now one of the countries where citizens request assistance circumventing a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029054.html">national firewall</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-September/000366.html">Grozdan</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-September/000370.html">Simon Gattner from Netzkonstrukt Berlin</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-October/000374.html">Wollomatic</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-October/000375.html">Haskell</a> for setting up new mirrors of the Tor project website.</p>

<p>Arlo Breault sent out a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030253.html">request for comments</a> on a possible new version of the check.torproject.org page.</p>

<p>Runa Sandvik <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030269.html">announced</a> that the Tor Stack Exchange page has moved from private beta to public beta. If you&#39;d like to help answer Tor-related questions (or ask them), <a href="http://tor.stackexchange.com/">get involved now</a>!</p>

<p>Philipp Winter sent out a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030252.html">call for testing</a> (and installation instructions) for the ScrambleSuit pluggable transports protocol.</p>

<p>Not strictly Tor-related, but Mike Perry started an <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030235.html">interesting discussion</a> about the “web of trust” system, as found in OpenPGP. The discussion was also held on the MonkeySphere mailing list, which prompted Daniel Kahn Gilmor to reply with many clarifications regarding the various properties and processes of the current implementation. To sum it up, Ximin Luo <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/monkeysphere/2013-10/msg00000.html">started</a> a <a href="https://github.com/infinity0/idsec/">new documentation project</a> “to describe and explain security issues relating to identity, in (hopefully) simple and non-implementation-specific language”.</p>

<p>The <em>listmaster</em> role has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/operations/Infrastructure/lists.torproject.org">better defined</a> and is now performed by a team consisting of Andrew Lewman, Damian Johnson, and Karsten Loesing. Thanks to them!</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine released an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-and-silk-road-takedown">official statement</a> on the Tor project blog regarding the takedown of the Silk Road hidden service and the arrest of its alleged operator.</p>

<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030405.html">asked</a> for reviews of “experimental Tor performance tuning for a Tor2web node.” Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/globaleaks/Tor2web-3.0/wiki/Performance-tuning">have a look</a> and provide feedback.</p>

<p>Claudiu-Vlad Ursache <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005545.html">announced</a> the initial release of <a href="https://github.com/ursachec/CPAProxy">CPAProxy</a>, “a thin Objective-C wrapper around Tor”. This is the first component of a project to “release a free open-source browser on the App Store that uses this wrapper and Tor to anonymize requests.” Claudiu-Vlad left several questions open, and solicited opinions on the larger goal.</p>

	      <p>And also the Washington Post article.</p>

<p>We&#39;re planning to write up a more detailed analysis later, but for now here&#39;s a place to centralize all the &quot;hey did you know about this article&quot; blog comments.</p>

<p>And for the journalists out there who want a statement, here&#39;s my quote from the article:</p>

<p>&quot;The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there&#39;s no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network. Infecting the laptop, phone, or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard.</p>

<p>Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody&#39;s going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on.</p>

<p>Just using Tor isn&#39;t enough to keep you safe in all cases. Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.&quot;</p>

	      <p>This is the second post in a two-part series on the build security improvements in the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-30">Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 release cycle</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">first post</a> described why such security is necessary. This post is meant to describe the technical details with respect to how such builds are produced.</p>

<p>We achieve our build security through a reproducible build process that enables anyone to produce byte-for-byte identical binaries to the ones we release. Elsewhere on the Internet, this process is varyingly called &quot;deterministic builds&quot;, &quot;reproducible builds&quot;, &quot;idempotent builds&quot;, and probably a few other terms, too.</p>

<p>To produce byte-for-byte identical packages, we use <a href="http://gitian.org/">Gitian</a> to build Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 and above, but that isn&#39;t the only option for achieving reproducible builds. We will first describe how we use Gitian, and then go on to enumerate the individual issues that Gitian solves for us, and that we had to solve ourselves through either wrapper scripts, hacks, build process patches, and (in one esoteric case for Windows) direct binary patching.</p>

<h1>Gitian: What is it?</h1>

<p><a href="http://gitian.org/howto.html">Gitian</a> is a thin wrapper around the Ubuntu virtualization tools written in a combination of Ruby and bash. It was originally developed by Bitcoin developers to ensure the build security and integrity of the Bitcoin software.</p>

<p>Gitian uses Ubuntu&#39;s python-vmbuilder to create a qcow2 base image for an Ubuntu version and architecture combination and a set of git and tarball inputs that you specify in a &#39;<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-firefox.yml">descriptor</a>&#39;, and then proceeds to run a shell script that you provide to build a component inside that controlled environment. This build process produces an output set that includes the compiled result and another &quot;output descriptor&quot; that captures the versions and hashes of all packages present on the machine during compilation.</p>

<p>Gitian requires either Intel VT support (for qemu-kvm), or LXC support, and currently only supports launching Ubuntu build environments from Ubuntu itself.</p>

<h1>Gitian: How Tor Uses It</h1>

<p><a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build">Tor&#39;s use of Gitian</a> is slightly more automated and also slightly different than how Bitcoin uses it.</p>

<p>First of all, because Gitian supports only Ubuntu hosts and targets, we must cross compile everything for Windows and MacOS. Luckily, Mozilla <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Cross_Compile_Mozilla_for_Mingw32">provides support</a> for <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/">MinGW-w64</a> as a &quot;third tier&quot; compiler, and does endeavor to work with the MinGW team to fix issues as they arise.</p>

<p>To our further good fortune, we were able to use a MacOS cross compiler created by <a href="https://github.com/mingwandroid">Ray Donnelly</a> based on a <a href="https://github.com/mingwandroid/toolchain4">fork of &quot;Toolchain4&quot;</a>. We owe Ray a great deal for providing his compilers to the public, and he has been most excellent in terms of helping us through any issues we encountered with them. Ray is also working to <a href="https://github.com/diorcety/crosstool-ng.git">merge his patches</a> into the <a href="http://crosstool-ng.org/">crosstools-ng project</a>, to provide a more seamless build process to create rebuilds of his compilers. As of this writing, we are still using <a href="https://mingw-and-ndk.googlecode.com/files/multiarch-darwin11-cctools127.2-gcc42-5666.3-llvmgcc42-2336.1-Linux-120724.tar.xz">his binaries</a> in combination with the <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eflosoft/+archive/cross-apple/+packages">flosoft MacOS10.X SDK</a>.</p>

<p>For each platform, we build the components of Tor Browser Bundle in 3 stages, with one descriptor per stage. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-tor.yml">first descriptor</a> builds Tor and its core dependency libraries (OpenSSL, libevent, and zlib) and produces one output zip file. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-firefox.yml">second descriptor</a> builds Firefox. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-bundle.yml">third descriptor</a> combines the previous two outputs along with our included Firefox addons and localization files to produce the actual localized bundle files.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/tree/HEAD:/gitian/">provide a Makefile and shellscript-based wrapper</a> around Gitian to automate the download and authentication of our source inputs prior to build, and to perform a final step that creates a sha256sums.txt file that lists all of the bundle hashes, and can be signed by any number of detached signatures, one for each builder.</p>

<p>It is important to distribute multiple cryptographic signatures to prevent targeted attacks against stealing a single build signing key (because the signing key itself is of course another single point of failure). Unfortunately, GPG currently lacks support for verifying multiple signatures of the same document. Users must manually copy each detached signature they wish to verify into its proper .asc filename suffix. Eventually, we hope to create a stub installer or wrapper script of some kind to simplify this step, as well as add multi-signature support to the Firefox update process. We are also investigating adding a URL and a hash of the package list the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/master:/dir-spec.txt">Tor Consensus</a>, so that the Tor Consensus document itself authenticates our binary packages.</p>

<p>We do not use the Gitian output descriptors or the Gitian signing tools, because the tools are used to sign Gitian&#39;s output descriptors. We found that Ubuntu&#39;s individual packages (which are listed in the output descriptors) varied too frequently to allow this mechanism to be reproducible for very long. However, we do include a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/versions">list of input versions and hashes</a> used to produce each bundle in the bundle itself. The format of this versions file is the same that we use as input to download the sources. This means it should remain possible to re-build an arbitrary bundle for verification at a later date, assuming that any later updates to Ubuntu&#39;s toolchain packages do not change the output.</p>

<h1>Gitian: Pain Points</h1>

<p>Gitian is not perfect. In fact, many who have tried our build system have remarked that it is not even close to deterministic (and that for this and other reasons &#39;Reproducible Builds&#39; is a better term). In fact, it seems to experience build failures for quite unpredictible reasons related to bugs in one or more of qemu-kvm/LXC, make, qcow copy-on-write image support. These bugs are often intermittent, and simply restarting the build process often causes things to proceed smoothly. This has made the bugs exceedingly tricky to pinpoint and diagnose.</p>

<p>Gitian&#39;s use of tags (especially signed tags) has some bugs and flaws. For this reason, we verify signatures ourselves after input fetching, and provide gitian only with explicit commit hashes for the input source repositories.</p>

<p>We maintain a list of the most common issues in the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build">build instructions</a>.</p>

<h1>Remaining Build Reproducibility Issues</h1>

<p>By default, the Gitian VM environment controls the following aspects of the build platform that normally vary and often leak into compiled software: hostname, build path, uname output, toolchain version, and time.</p>

<p>However, Gitian is not enough by itself to magically produce reproducible builds. Beyond what Gitian provides, we had to patch a number of reproducibility issues in Firefox and some of the supporting tools on each platform. These include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reordering due to inode ordering differences (exposed via Python&#39;s os.walk())</strong></p>

<p>Several places in the Firefox build process use python scripts to repackage both compiled library archives and zip files. In particular, they tend to obtain directory listings using os.walk(), which is dependent upon the inode ordering of the filesystem. We fix this by sorting those file lists in the applicable places.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LC_ALL localizations alter sorting order</strong></p>

<p>Sorting only gets you so far, though, if someone from a different locale is trying to reproduce your build. Differences in your character sets will cause these sort orders to differ. For this reason, we set the LC_ALL environment variable to &#39;C&#39; at the top of our Gitian descriptors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hostname and other OS info leaks in LXC mode</strong></p>

<p>For these cases, we simply patch the pieces of Firefox that include the hostname (primarily for <a href="about:buildconfig">about:buildconfig</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Millisecond and below timestamps are not fixed by libfaketime</strong></p>

<p>Gitian relies on <a href="http://www.code-wizards.com/projects/libfaketime/">libfaketime</a> to set the clock to a fixed value to deal with embedded timestamps in archives and in the build process. However, in some places, Firefox inserts millisecond timestamps into its supporting libraries as part of an informational structure. We simply zero these fields.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FIPS-140 mode generates throwaway signing keys</strong></p>

<p>A rather insane subsection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140">FIPS-140</a> certification standard requires that you distribute signatures for all of your cryptographic libraries. The Firefox build process meets this requirement by generating a temporary key, using it to sign the libraries, and discarding the private portion of that key. Because there are many other ways to intercept the crypto outside of modifying the actual DLL images, we opted to simply remove these signature files from distribution. There simply is no way to verify code integrity on a running system without both OS and coprocessor assistance. Download package signatures make sense of course, but we handle those another way (as mentioned above).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On Windows builds, something mysterious causes 3 bytes to randomly vary<br>
 in the binary.</strong></p>

<p>Unable to determine the source of this, we just bitstomp the binary and regenerate the PE header checksums using strip... Seems fine so far! ;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>umask leaks into LXC mode in some cases</strong></p>

<p>We fix this by manually setting umask at the top of our Gitian descriptors. Additionally, we found that we had to reset the permissions inside of tar and zip files, as the umask didn&#39;t affect them on some builds (but not others...)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zip and Tar reordering and attribute issues</strong></p>

<p>To aid with this and other issues with reproducibility, we created simple shell wrappers for <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/build-helpers/dzip.sh">zip</a> and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/build-helpers/dtar.sh">tar</a> to eliminate the sources of non-determinism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timezone leaks</strong>
To deal with these, we set TZ=UTC at the top of our descriptors.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Future Work</h1>

<p>The most common question we&#39;ve been asked about this build process is: What can be done to prevent the adversary from compromising the (substantially weaker) Ubuntu build and packaging processes, and further, what about the <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html">Trusting Trust attack</a>?</p>

<p>In terms of eliminating the remaining single points of compromise, the first order of business is to build all of our compilers and toolchain directly from sources via their own Gitian descriptors.</p>

<p>Once this is accomplished, we can begin the process of building identical binaries from multiple different Linux distributions. This would require the adversary to compromise multiple Linux distributions in order to compromise the Tor software distribution.</p>

<p>If we can support reproducible builds through cross compiling from multiple architectures (Intel, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc), this also reduces the likelihood of a Trusting Trust attack surviving unnoticed in the toolchain (because the machine code that injects the payload would have to be pre-compiled and present for all copies of the cross-compiled executable code in a way that is still not visible in the sources).</p>

<p>If those Linux distributions also support reproducible builds of the full build and toolchain environment (both <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds">Debian</a> and <a href="http://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/09/18/reproducible-builds-for-fedora/">Fedora</a> have started this), we can eliminate Trusting Trust attacks entirely by using <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html">Diverse Double Compilation</a> between multiple independent distribution toolchains, and/or assembly audited compilers. In other words, we could use the distributions&#39; deterministic build processes to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/555902/">verify</a> that identical build environments are produced through Diverse Double Compilation.</p>

<p>As can be seen, much work remains before the system is fully resistant against all forms of malware injection, but even in their current state, reproducible builds are a huge step forward in software build security. We hope this information helps other software distributors to follow the example set by Bitcoin and Tor.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>We&#39;ve had several requests by the press and others to talk about the Silk Road situation today. We only know what&#39;s going on by reading the same news sources everyone else is reading.</p>

<p>In this case we&#39;ve been watching carefully to try to learn if there are any flaws with Tor that we need to correct. So far, nothing about this case makes us think that there are new ways to compromise Tor (the software or the network). The FBI says that their suspect made mistakes in operational security, and was found through actual detective work. Remember: Tor does not anonymize individuals when they use their legal name on a public forum, use a VPN with logs that are subject to a subpoena, or provide personal information to other services. See also the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">list of warnings linked from the Tor download page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, while we&#39;ve seen no evidence that this case involved breaking into the webserver behind the hidden service, we should take this opportunity to emphasize that Tor&#39;s hidden service feature (a way to publish and access content anonymously) won&#39;t keep someone anonymous when paired with unsafe software or unsafe behavior. It is up to the publisher to choose and configure server software that is resistant to attacks. Mistakes in configuring or maintaining a hidden service website can compromise the publisher&#39;s anonymity independent of Tor.</p>

<p>And finally, Tor&#39;s design goals include preventing even The Tor Project from tracking users; hidden services are no different. We don&#39;t have any special access to or information about this hidden service or any other. Because Tor is open-source and it comes with detailed design documents and research papers, independent researchers can verify its security.</p>
