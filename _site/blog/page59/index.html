          <p><a href="https://tails.boum.org/">The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails)</a>, version 0.10, is out.</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<p>Notable user-visible changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tor: upgrade to 0.2.2.35-1.</li>
<li><p>Iceweasel</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Iceweasel 9.0 from the Debian Mozilla team&#39;s APT repository.</li>
<li>Update Torbutton to 1.4.5.1-1.</li>
<li>Support viewing any YouTube video that is available in HTML5 format.</li>
<li>Use Scroogle (any languages) instead of Scroogle (English only) when booted in English. Many users choose English because their own language is not supported yet; let&#39;s not hide them search results in their own language.</li>
<li>Install the NoScript Firefox extension; configure it the same way as the TBB does.</li>
<li>Disable third-party cookies. They can be used to track users, which is bad. Besides, this is what TBB has been doing for years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do not transparently proxy outgoing Internet connections through Tor. Instead drop all non-Torified Internet traffic. Hence applications has to be explicitly configured to use Tor in order to reach the Internet from now on.</p></li>
<li><p>Software</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade Vidalia to 0.2.15-1+tails1. This version will not warn about new Tor versions (this is handled by Tails security check instead).</li>
<li>Upgrade MAT to 0.2.2-1~bpo60+1.</li>
<li>Upgrade VirtualBox guest software to 4.1.6-dfsg-2~bpo60+1, built against the ABI of X.Org backports.</li>
<li>Upgrade I2P to 0.8.11; the start script (which was broken in Tails 0.9) is now fixed.</li>
<li>Install unar (The Unarchiver) instead of the non-free unrar.</li>
<li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/">Install Nautilus Wipe</a> instead of custom Nautilus scripts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hardware support</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.1.6-1.</li>
<li>Upgrade to X.Org from squeeze-backports.</li>
<li>Install more, and more recent b43 firmwares.</li>
<li>Upgrade barry to 0.15-1.2~bpo60+1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Internationalization</p>

<ul>
<li>Add basic language support for Russian, Farsi and Vietnamese.</li>
<li>Install some Indic fonts.</li>
<li>Install some Russian fonts.</li>
<li>Add Alt+Shift shortcut to switch keyboard layout.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Miscellaneous</p>

<ul>
<li>Support booting in &quot; <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/windows_theme/">Windows XP-like camouflage mode</a>&quot;.</li>
<li>Do not fetch APT translation files. Running apt-get update is heavy enough.</li>
<li>Add MSN support thanks to msn-pecan.</li>
<li>Add custom SSH client configuration:</li>
<li>Prefer strong ciphers and MACs.</li>
<li>Enable maximum compression level.</li>
<li>Explicitly disable X11 forwarding.</li>
<li>Connect as root by default, to prevent fingerprinting when username was not specified.</li>
<li>Replace flawed FireGPG with a home-made GnuPG encryption applet; install a feature-stripped FireGPG that redirects users to <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/FireGPG_susceptible_to_devastating_attacks/">the documentation</a>, and don&#39;t run Seahorse applet anymore.</li>
<li>Blank screen when lid is closed, rather than shutting down the system. The shutdown &quot;feature&quot; has caused data losses for too many people, it seems. There are many other ways a Tails system can be shut down in a hurry these days.</li>
<li>Fix bug in the Pidgin nick generation that resulted in the nick &quot;XXX_NICK_XXX&quot; once out of twenty.</li>
<li>Pre-configure the #tor IRC discussion channel in Pidgin.</li>
<li>Reintroduce the htpdate notification, telling users when it&#39;s safe to use Tor Hidden Services.</li>
<li>Various htpdate improvements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Plus the usual bunch of minor bug reports and improvements.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.10">online Changelog</a> for technical details.</p>

<p><strong>I want to try it / to upgrade!</strong></p>

<p>See the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/getting_started/">Getting started</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Known issue</strong></p>

<p>The memory erasure on Tails shutdown cannot guarantee that all memory in the 2 GB to 4 GB region is wiped. The improvements made in Tails 0.10 should at least make the situation better than previously.</p>

          <p>Getting good stories for Tor successes is tricky, because if Tor is doing its job, nobody notices. I know a lot of people who have really interesting Tor success stories and have no interest in telling the world who they are and how they managed (until that moment when everybody is reading about them, that is) to stay safe.</p>

<p>Still, there are a bunch of other stories out there that haven&#39;t been documented as well. For example, I really like Nasser&#39;s story about his experiences in Mauritania:
 <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/" title="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/">http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/</a></p>

<p>Hidden services have gotten less broad attention from the Tor user base, since most people who install Tor have a website in mind like twitter or indymedia that they want to visit safely. Some good use cases that we&#39;ve seen for hidden services in particular include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I know people (for example, in countries that have been undergoing revolutions lately) who run popular blogs but their blogs kept getting knocked offline by state-sponsored jerks. The common blogging software they used (like Wordpress) couldn&#39;t stand up to the ddos attacks and breakins. The solution was to split the blog into a public side, which is static html and has no logins, and a private side for posting, which is only reachable over a Tor hidden service. Now their blog works again and they&#39;re reaching their audiences. And as a bonus, the nice fellow hosting the private side for them doesn&#39;t need to let people know where it is, and even if somebody figures it out, the nice fellow hosting it doesn&#39;t have any IP addresses to hand over or lose.</p></li>
<li><p>Whistleblowing websites want to provide documents from a platform that is hard for upset corporations or governments to censor. See e.g. <a href="http://globaleaks.org/" title="http://globaleaks.org/">http://globaleaks.org/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Google for &#39;indymedia fbi seize&#39;. When Indymedia offers a hidden service version of their website, censoring organizations don&#39;t know which data centers to bully into handing over the hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Data retention laws in Europe (and soon in the US too at this rate) threaten to make centralized chat networks vulnerable to social network analysis (step one, collect all the data; step two, get broken into by corporations, criminals, external governments, you name it; step three comes identity theft, stalking, targeted scam jobs, etc etc). What if you had a chat network where all the users were on hidden services by default? Now there&#39;s no easy central point to learn who&#39;s talking to who and when. Building one and making it usable turns out to be hard. But good thing we have this versatile tool here as a building block.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s a start. It is certainly the case that we (Tor) spend most of our time making the technology better, and not so much of our time figuring out how to market it and change the world&#39;s perception on whether being safe online is worthwhile. Please help. :)</p>

          <p>Greetings! My name is Tim Wilde, Software Engineer at Team Cymru, Inc., and a big fan of the Tor Project and everything that they do. We&#39;ve helped out the Tor Project with a few investigations into probing/blocking of Tor by oppressive regimes, and the guys asked me to write this one up for the Tor Blog, so here I am! Note: any opinions expressed here are mine, nor those of Team Cymru or the Tor Project.</p>

<p>In October 2011, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4185">ticket #4185</a> was filed in the Tor bug tracker by a user in China who found that their connections to US-based Tor bridge relays were being regularly cut off after a very short period of time. At the time we performed some basic experimentation and discovered that Chinese IPs (presumably at the behest of the Great Firewall of China, or GFW) would reach out to the US-based bridge and connect to it shortly after the Tor user in China connected, and, if successful, shortly thereafter the connection would be blocked by the GFW. There wasn&#39;t time for a detailed investigation and analysis at the time, but that kernel eventually grew into the investigation detailed below. We were, however, able to determine that limiting connections to the bridge relay to only the single IP expected to be its client would, in fact, block the probes and allow the connection to remain open for an extended period (&gt;48 hours in our testing).</p>

<p>Between 05 DEC and 09 DEC 2011, we undertook a detailed and methodical investigation into probing and blocking of Tor connections originating within China. Unfortunately for our analysis, it appears that the GFW&#39;s active blocking of connections to Tor bridges had stopped, but we were still able to gather valuable data about the probing performed by the GFW, which previously led directly and verifiably to blocking.</p>

<p>To this end we discovered two types of probing. First, &quot;garbage binary&quot; probes, containing nothing more than arbitrary (but sometimes repeated in later probes) binary data, were experienced by the non-China side of any connection that originated from China to TCP port 443 (HTTPS) in which an SSL negotiation was performed. This probe was performed in near-real-time after the connection was established, implying near-line-rate deep packet inspection (DPI) capabilities. TCP/443 connections not performing an SSL handshake, such as using the obfsproxy obfs2 protocol or a plain-text protocol, did not provoke probing. The purpose of these probes is unknown, and further investigation is difficult to justify when it seems relatively clear that these probes are not aimed at Tor.</p>

<p>The second type of probe, on the other hand, is aimed quite directly at Tor. When a Tor client within China connected to a US-based bridge relay, we consistently found that at the next round 15 minute interval (HH:00, HH:15, HH:30, HH:45), the bridge relay would receive a probe from hosts within China that not only established a TCP connection, but performed an SSL negotiation, an SSL renegotiation, and then spoke the Tor protocol sufficiently to build a one-hop circuit and send a BEGIN_DIR cell. No matter what TCP port the bridge was listening on, once a Tor client from China connected, within 3 minutes of the next 15 minute interval we saw a series of probes including at least one connection speaking the Tor protocol.</p>

<p>The good news is, we were able to isolate which characteristic of the Tor handshake the GFW was using to decide whether or not to initiate these probes. By making a simple change to the list of supported SSL ciphers in the &quot;hello&quot; packet sent by the Tor client within China, we were able to prevent the probes from taking place. This has been documented and is being discussed in <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4744">ticket #4744</a>. This differs slightly from the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix">method used by Iran to block Tor in September 2011</a>, using the client-side of the SSL negotiation as its trigger rather than the server-side. It is likely, however, that technology capable of targeting either side of the connection to this degree could also target the other side, so it remains important to consider both the server and client sides of the Tor connection when attempting to blend in with normal, benign traffic.</p>

<p>The bad news, however, is that this is happening at all. This probe again implies sophisticated near-line-rate DPI technology, coupled with a system that is aimed directly at Tor, using code that actually speaks the Tor protocol. Clearly there is a target painted firmly on Tor, and it is quite likely that the Chinese will continue to adapt their censorship technology as the Tor Project adapts to them.</p>

<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel, though. A number of ideas have been put forward about new protocols, handshakes, and extensions to the Tor protocol that could be used to combat this type of censorship technology in a more long-term-sustainable way. <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/190-password-bridge-authorization.txt">Proposal 190</a> provides for password authorization for bridge relays. <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/tor-obfs-howto.txt">obfsproxy</a> provides an extra layer on top of a Tor connection that makes it look like generic binary data. The Tor v3 link protocol/handshake, currently available and in testing in the 0.2.3.x-alpha series of Tor releases, eliminates SSL renegotiation in Tor session establishment, removing one of Tor&#39;s current &quot;sore thumbs&quot; that stick out from normal HTTPS SSL traffic.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to check out my <a href="https://gist.github.com/da3c7a9af01d74cd7de7">full report on this investigation</a> for more detail than I could provide in the blog post here. Thanks very much to everyone who assisted with the investigation and the report! It was fun to investigate and report on this, and I hope to have the opportunity to help out with similar adventures in the future.</p>
