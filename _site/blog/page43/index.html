        <p><p>After our standard audit, our 2011 state and federal <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en">tax filings</a> are available. We publish all of our related tax documents because we believe in transparency. All US non-profit organizations are required by law to make their tax filings available to the public on request by US citizens. We want to make them available for all.</p>

<p>Part of our transparency is simply publishing the tax documents for your review. The other part is publishing what we&#39;re <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors">working on</a> in detail. We hope you&#39;ll join us in furthering our mission (a) to develop, improve and distribute free, publicly available tools and programs that promote free speech, free expression, civic engagement and privacy rights online; (b) to conduct scientific research regarding, and to promote the use of and knowledge about, such tools, programs and related issues around the world; (c) to educate the general public around the world about privacy rights and anonymity issues connected to Internet use.</p>

<p>All of this means you can look through all of our <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/">source code</a>, including our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation#DesignDoc">design documents</a>, and all open tasks, enhancements, and bugs available on our <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/">tracking system</a>. Our <a href="https://research.torproject.org/">research</a> reports are available as well. From a technical perspective, all of this free software, documentation, and code allows you and others to assess the safety and trustworthiness of our research and development. On another level, we have a 10 year track record of doing high quality work, saying what we&#39;re going to do, and doing what we said.</p>

<p>The world is moving towards new norms for reduced personal privacy and control. This makes anonymity all that more rare and valuable. Please help keep us going through <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">getting involved</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en">donations</a>, or advocating for a free Internet with privacy, anonymity, and keeping control of your identity.</p>

        <p><p>I was invited by <a href="http://employersagainstdomesticviolence.org/">Employers Against Domestic Violence</a> to give a talk about technology and stalking as part of a larger panel.</p>

<p>On Friday the 16th, I presented Tor and our work with victims of abuse and stalking to around 50 people. Most of my <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2012-11-16-EADV-Tech-Stalking-Advice.pdf">full presentation</a> covered the basics of Tor, a demo of <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails Live System</a>, and then some user stories. Most of the people in the audience were already DV advocates and aware of the way technology is used to harm or manipulate others. The user stories have come from a number of places, between phone calls, email support, and actually being out in the world talking to survivors or advocates who want to help.</p>

<p>I co-presented with Sarah from <a href="https://www.abine.com">Abine</a> and Valenda from <a href="http://gbls.org/">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>. All three of our presentations can be found on Tor&#39;s <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eandrew/2012-11-16-EADV/">people server</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a number of people came up to me to ask about getting Tails or Tor Browser, or to simply introduce themselves. I met a cyber-stalking survivor I&#39;ve only helped via email and phone over the past year or so. I look forward to doing more of these types of events locally.</p>

        <p><p>Ohio University EW Scripps Journalism School Trip Report for 07 to 09 November 2012</p>

<p>Danny O&#39;Brien of <a href="https://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> and I were invited to talk to journalism students at the <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/">E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a> in <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/">Ohio University</a>. The topics were around computer security risks and protections from the perspective of journalists. CPJ maintains a great guide for reporters to survive dangerous situations appropriately called the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php">Journalist Security Guide</a>. This covers both offline and online situations. My role was to highlight the experience of Tor, what we&#39;ve seen, and how we&#39;ve protected both citizen and professional journalists the world over. I also covered using <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> as one tool in your toolbox to let you do the work of a journalist from anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20alexanda">Andy Alexander</a> was our host for the three days. We started off with a great dinner to share information about what both Danny and I have learned over the past few years in working with journalists. Andy has a long career of experience in foreign correspondence and reporting. His experiences covering a few decades highlight the need for journalists to learn how to protect themselves when reporting anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The next day was a first-year class about journalism in general. Danny and I presented to around 200 students. The computer couldn&#39;t read my USB drive, so I couldn&#39;t use <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2012-11-08-Scripps-IIJ-Presentation.pdf">my presentation</a>, rather I used the website to quickly cover Tor, how it works, and why journalists should care. I then discussed a range of attacks against an individual from fairly basic malware infections through more advanced traffic analysis and content swapping. My <a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox">PirateBox</a> did work, so anyone could get the presentations and copies of Tor locally if they so desired.</p>

<p>We had a great lunch with <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20kalyango">Professor Kalyango</a> and then head off to <a href="http://woub.org/news">WOUB</a> for a 30 minute podcast/radio interview.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we went off to the main panel event to talk to fourth year and graduate students about online security and the risks for journalists. Once again, the USB drive couldn&#39;t be read, but the <a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox">PirateBox</a> worked fine. The lecture lasted around 90 minutes with a Q&amp;A session. Unlike the freshman class, a number of people had questions or wanted to verify what Danny and I stated.</p>

<p>We were then taken out to dinner by the top students at the J School. It was a great Middle Eastern kabob place to have an hour of discussions with the students.</p>

<p>And thanks to <a href="http://www.athensinteractivist.com/">Lindsay</a> for getting up at 06:30 to drive me to the airport and for the great discussion along the way. I look forward to reading her dispatches from East Africa in the near future.</p>
