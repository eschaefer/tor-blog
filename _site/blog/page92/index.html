          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Although it has been a while since GSoC ended, I want to give a quick run-down of my project and how everything went over the summer. The plan was to migrate the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/index.html" title="tor metrics portal">Tor metrics portal</a> from the file based system to a database driven one. This allows us to have a more dynamic website and a better interface to derive our statistics and visuals from. I spent most of my time designing the database schema (which had to be carefully optimized due to the amount of data we have), and the remainder of the time working on things such as <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/graphs.html" title="dynamic graphs">dynamic graphs</a> and migrating the website to Java Server Pages. Thankfully, I finished almost everything I had planned to do, and it seems as though my work this summer is being put to good use! A significant amount of my metrics code has been merged, which is certainly a good feeling.</p>

<p>While I did not have any specific research questions in mind, I was able to uncover some interesting things by exploring the wealth of data in front of me. One of the things I promised to deliver was relay churn - a statistic to show the stability of the network. The Y axis, or the &quot;churn ratio&quot; is rather abstract, but it tells us the percentage of unique router fingerprints from one cohort that appear in the following cohort. Unfortunately, it requires a significant amount of database power to produce (large table scans are necessary when grouping routers by time period - the smaller the interval the longer the operation takes). However, the logic is clear and is easily accomplished from the database. The churn graphs may find their way onto the website, but the underlying processes may need to be optimized further. Either way, a database system ought to open a few doors for us in regards to some of the interesting things we can easily explore. See some of the churn graphs <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/relay-churn-week.png">here</a>, and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/relay-churn-month.png" title="relay churn month">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the back-end and database work, I explored <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> and the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> language - the tools used to generate the graphs on the metrics portal. Currently, R communicates with the database to generate graphs on demand (I settled on a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rpostgresql/">Postgres driver</a> for R which was part of GSoC 2008). The goal was to make the graphs parametizable so a user can request a custom or unique graph. The graphs are then served from <a href="http://rosuda.org/Rserve/">Rserve</a> and Apache Tomcat. A few examples of the parametizable graphs are currently live on the metrics website which were implemented by Karsten.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the rest of the GSoC&#39;ers John, Kory, and Harry for their successful projects. I want to give a big thank you to @KarstenLoesing for being such a great guide for my foray into the Tor Project and open-source development. It has been a great learning experience. Many thanks to Tor and Google for the opportunity!</p>

<p><strong>New Releases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tor Browser Bundle for Mac OS X is now available for the i386 architecture in 11 languages. This is an alpha release to let the community test functionality. Read more at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-mac-os-x" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-mac-os-x">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-mac-os-x</a></li>
<li>Orbot, Tor for Android, was released into the Android Market. Android users can now officially download and install Orbot on their devices. <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/" title="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/</a></li>
<li>Version 0.2.10 of the graphical controller for tor, Vidalia, is now available. The main change is the use of Tor&#39;s native geoip database to map relay IP addresses to country. This removes the remote geoip resolution that occurred over Tor in previous versions of Vidalia.

<li>Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha was released, Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha fixes a variety of old stream fairness bugs (most evident at exit relays), and also continues to resolve all the little
bugs that have been filling up trac lately. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02216-alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02216-alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02216-alpha-released</a></li>
<li>We released Torbutton 1.3.0-alpha. Torbutton 1.3.0-alpha is the first release of Torbutton where most of the code has come from our community members! The full announcement is available at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Sep-2010/msg00140.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Sep-2010/msg00140.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Sep-2010/msg00140.html</a>.</li>
<li>Tor 0.2.2.17-alpha introduces a feature to make it harder for clients to use one-hop circuits (which can put the exit relays at higher risk, plus unbalance the network); fixes a big bug in bandwidth accounting for relays that want to limit their monthly bandwidth use; fixes a big pile of bugs in how clients tolerate temporary network failure; and makes our adaptive circuit build timeout feature (which improves client performance if your network is fast while not breaking things if your network is slow) better handle bad networks. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02217-alpha-out" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02217-alpha-out">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02217-alpha-out</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong>
Mike wrote up the current state of progress on a torbutton extension for Google&#39;s Chrome web browser, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fingerprinting" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fingerprinting">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fi...</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture and technical design docs for Tor enhancements related to blocking-resistance.</strong>
Steven submitted a proposal to automatically promote nodes to bridges. This proposal describes how Tor clients could determine when they have sufficient bandwidth capacity and are sufficiently reliable to become either bridges or Tor relays. When they meet this criteria, they will automatically promote themselves, based on user preferences. The proposal also defines the new controller messages and options which will control this process. <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/175-automatic-node-promotion.txt" title="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob\_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/175-automatic-node-promotion.txt">https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposal...</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Outreach and Advocacy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We released an article about the ``Ten Things to Look for in a Circumvention Tool&#39;&#39;. As more countries crack down on Internet use, people around the world are turning to anti-censorship software that lets them reach blocked websites. Many types of software, also known as circumvention tools, have been created to answer the threat to freedom online. These tools provide different features and levels of security, and it&#39;s important for users to understand the tradeoffs. This article lays out ten features you should consider when evaluating a circumvention tool. The goal isn&#39;t to advocate for any specific tool, but to point out what kind of tools are useful for different situations. Full details at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2010-09-16-ten-things-circumvention-tools.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/press/2010-09-16-ten-things-circumvention-tools.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/press/2010-09-16-ten-things-circumvention-too...</a></li>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Erinn synchronized the Windows, OS X, and Linux tor browser bundles to use the same configurations and included software.</li>
<li>The TAILS team continues to improve and update their LiveCD available at <a href="https://amnesia.boum.org" title="https://amnesia.boum.org">https://amnesia.boum.org</a>.</li>
<li>Jacob began an audit of the TAILS LiveCD to help assess the safety and security of the software for users in highly-volatile situations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong>
Created Tor 0.2.3 branch and started work on integrated bufferevents and microdescriptors. Bufferevents are the proper way to manage heavy network i/o in Microsoft Windows. Microdescriptors are a way to let clients on extremely low-bandwidth connections bootstrap into the Tor network. Proposal 158, <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/158-microdescriptors.txt" title="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob\_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/158-microdescriptors.txt">https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposal...</a>, defines microdescriptors.</p>

<p><strong>Translation work</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We began the migration from our Pootle-based translation portal to Transifex after a discussion with their developers. Transifex provides free hosting of their translation software for free software projects and access to thousands of translators shared between hosted projects. All of our translations will be completed through Transifex going forward. <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/torproject/" title="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/torproject/">https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/torproject/</a>.</li>
<li>Updated translations for Russian, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Burmese, French, Italian, Swedish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Polish, and Simplified Chinese.</li>

	      <p>We have heard from web server operators who are wondering how many of
their visitors are using Tor to do so.</p>

<p>We can now answer this question. We have an exit list archive back to
February 2010 and a tool to compare an Apache HTTP server log to these
lists. We can further guess how many of the requests come from Torbutton
users by looking at the user-agent string.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of sensitive data involved here, which is why we give out
the archived exit lists and our tool so that web server operators can
run the comparison themselves.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll find the exit list archive and the VisiTor tool here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html#exitlist" title="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html#exitlist">https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html#exitlist</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you are running a web server and want to help us make the tool
better, please download the sources, review the 350 lines of finest
Java code, run the tool on your machine, and let us know how that works!</p>

<p>The original announcement is <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00001.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00001.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00001.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.17-alpha - 2010-09-30
o Major features:
- Exit relays now try harder to block exit attempts from unknown
relays, to make it harder for people to use them as one-hop proxies
a la tortunnel. Controlled by the refuseunknownexits consensus
parameter (currently enabled), or you can override it on your
relay with the RefuseUnknownExits torrc option. Resolves bug 1751.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (0.2.1.x and earlier):
- Fix a bug in bandwidth accounting that could make us use twice
the intended bandwidth when our interval start changes due to
daylight saving time. Now we tolerate skew in stored vs computed
interval starts: if the start of the period changes by no more than
50% of the period&#39;s duration, we remember bytes that we transferred
in the old period. Fixes bug 1511; bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.
- Always search the Windows system directory for system DLLs, and
nowhere else. Bugfix on 0.1.1.23; fixes bug 1954.
- When you&#39;re using bridges and your network goes away and your
bridges get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks
connection (if the network is back), rather than waiting up to an
hour to try fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on
0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1981.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):
- Fix compilation on Windows. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha; related to
bug 1797.
- Fix a segfault that could happen when operating a bridge relay with
no GeoIP database set. Fixes bug 1964; bugfix on 0.2.2.15-alpha.
- The consensus bandwidth-weights (used by clients to choose fast
relays) entered an unexpected edge case in September where
Exits were much scarcer than Guards, resulting in bad weight
recommendations. Now we compute them using new constraints that
should succeed in all cases. Also alter directory authorities to
not include the bandwidth-weights line if they fail to produce
valid values. Fixes bug 1952; bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha.
- When weighting bridges during path selection, we used to trust
the bandwidths they provided in their descriptor, only capping them
at 10MB/s. This turned out to be problematic for two reasons:
Bridges could claim to handle a lot more traffic then they
actually would, thus making more clients pick them and have a
pretty effective DoS attack. The other issue is that new bridges
that might not have a good estimate for their bw capacity yet
would not get used at all unless no other bridges are available
to a client. Fixes bug 1912; bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (on the circuit build timeout feature, 0.2.2.x):
- Ignore cannibalized circuits when recording circuit build times.
This should provide for a minor performance improvement for hidden
service users using 0.2.2.14-alpha, and should remove two spurious
notice log messages. Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug 1740.
- Simplify the logic that causes us to decide if the network is
unavailable for purposes of recording circuit build times. If we
receive no cells whatsoever for the entire duration of a circuit&#39;s
full measured lifetime, the network is probably down. Also ignore
one-hop directory fetching circuit timeouts when calculating our
circuit build times. These changes should hopefully reduce the
cases where we see ridiculous circuit build timeouts for people
with spotty wireless connections. Fixes part of bug 1772; bugfix
on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
- Prevent the circuit build timeout from becoming larger than
the maximum build time we have ever seen. Also, prevent the time
period for measurement circuits from becoming larger than twice that
value. Fixes the other part of bug 1772; bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor features:
- When we run out of directory information such that we can&#39;t build
circuits, but then get enough that we can build circuits, log when
we actually construct a circuit, so the user has a better chance of
knowing what&#39;s going on. Fixes bug 1362.
- Be more generous with how much bandwidth we&#39;d use up (with
accounting enabled) before entering &quot;soft hibernation&quot;. Previously,
we&#39;d refuse new connections and circuits once we&#39;d used up 95% of
our allotment. Now, we use up 95% of our allotment, AND make sure
that we have no more than 500MB (or 3 hours of expected traffic,
whichever is lower) remaining before we enter soft hibernation.
- If we&#39;ve configured EntryNodes and our network goes away and/or all
our entrynodes get marked down, optimistically retry them all when
a new socks application request appears. Fixes bug 1882.
- Add some more defensive programming for architectures that can&#39;t
handle unaligned integer accesses. We don&#39;t know of any actual bugs
right now, but that&#39;s the best time to fix them. Fixes bug 1943.
- Support line continuations in the torrc config file. If a line
ends with a single backslash character, the newline is ignored, and
the configuration value is treated as continuing on the next line.
Resolves bug 1929.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x and earlier):
- For bandwidth accounting, calculate our expected bandwidth rate
based on the time during which we were active and not in
soft-hibernation during the last interval. Previously, we were
also considering the time spent in soft-hibernation. If this
was a long time, we would wind up underestimating our bandwidth
by a lot, and skewing our wakeup time towards the start of the
accounting interval. Fixes bug 1789. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):
- Resume generating CIRC FAILED REASON=TIMEOUT control port messages,
which were disabled by the circuit build timeout changes in
0.2.2.14-alpha. Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug 1739.
- Make sure we don&#39;t warn about missing bandwidth weights when
choosing bridges or other relays not in the consensus. Bugfix on
0.2.2.10-alpha; fixes bug 1805.
- In our logs, do not double-report signatures from unrecognized
authorities both as &quot;from unknown authority&quot; and &quot;not
present&quot;. Fixes bug 1956, bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha.</p>
