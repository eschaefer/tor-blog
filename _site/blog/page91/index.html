          <p>Tor Browser Bundle for Mac OS X is now available for the i386 architecture in 11 languages. <strong>Snow Leopard users</strong> : please read about the known bugs at the bottom of the post.</p>

<p>The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser and is self-contained.</p>

<p>You can download it from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/">Tor Browser</a> page which also has instructions about how to extract and use it.</p>

<p>The bundle comes with the following software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/">Vidalia 0.2.10</a> -- cross-platform controller GUI for the Tor software</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pps.jussieu.fr/%7Ejch/software/polipo/">Polipo 1.0.4.1</a> -- caching web proxy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox/Namoroka 3.6.9</a> -- web browser</li>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/">Torbutton 1.2.5</a> -- Firefox extension to enable or disable the browser&#39;s use of Tor</li>
<li><a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript 2.0.2.3</a> -- Firefox extension to only allow scripts from trusted sites</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS-Everywhere 0.2.2</a> -- Firefox extension to provide encryption to a major number of websites</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a beta version which has primarily been tested on an i386 Leopard machine.</p>

<p>Early testers on Snow Leopard report that Firefox does not launch the first time they launch the Tor Browser Bundle app. The workaround for this is currently to stop Tor with Vidalia and then restart it. They also say that the Torbutton status bar on the bottom of the Firefox window does not show up, but Torbutton functions properly. Please give us feedback and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/">file bugs</a>.</p>

          <p>We&#39;re holding a Tor hackfest this Sunday, the 19th. Tor&#39;s Chief Architect, Nick Mathewson, will be explaining Tor&#39;s goals and what the project has been up to lately, and then we&#39;ll pick a few day-sized projects to work on together with his help.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be meeting at 2pm in the new Media Lab building (E14), room 240, thanks to the Center for Future Civic Media at MIT. Since the building is closed on Sundays, please e-mail <a href="mailto:chris-torfest@printf.net">chris-torfest@printf.net</a> before Sunday to get a phone number to use to be let in. We&#39;re hoping to provide pizza and drinks, and we&#39;ll finish up and move to Grendel&#39;s Den around 9pm.</p>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>A few months back, I posted that <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-private-browsing-mode-torbutton-and-fingerprinting">we have been in discussion</a> with Mozilla about improving their Private Browsing mode to resist <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting">fingerprinting</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing">network adversary</a>. As I mentioned there, we have also been doing the same thing with Google for Google Chrome. Google has taken the same approach as Firefox for their Incognito mode, which means that it provides little to no protections against a network adversary.</p>

<p>This means that Chrome Incognito mode is not safe to use with Tor.</p>

<h1>The Story So Far</h1>

<p>In general, Incognito&#39;s major shortcomings are plugins, fingerprinting, DNS leaks, SSL state leaks, auto-formfill and site-specific zoom. The Applied Crypto research group at Stanford recently published a <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/%7Edabo/pubs/abstracts/privatebrowsing.html">comparison of the four major browser&#39;s private browsing modes</a> against a dedicated local and remote adversary which details some of these issues. The added poison for Tor is that plugins and DNS leaks can also reveal your IP address and complete web activity to the network adversary.</p>

<p>So, starting almost a year ago, we began providing feedback on Google Chrome&#39;s extension system APIs to ensure that Google is aware of the APIs that we and others need to write defenses against a network adversary.</p>

<p>We drew up <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/ceba26ca9e2f6a78/e83920020719a6b2">a wish list of API categories</a> that would be useful for privacy enhancing extensions. Many of the items on that first list were a bit far-reaching, and not all were strictly required to produce a Tor Mode for Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Over the past year, a rather astonishing amount of progress has been made on the Google Chrome Extension API set and also on many items of that list. In fact, work is now in progress on all the major API sets that we need to build a Tor Mode for Google Chrome, to port <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/https-everywhere-firefox-addon-helps-you-encrypt-web-traffic">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, and also write a separate extension to provide defenses against fingerprinting and a network adversary, all using much simpler mechanisms that we had to use for the equivalent functionality in Firefox. It should also soon be possible for many similar privacy and security enhancing extensions to follow suit.</p>

<h1>Key Security and Privacy Enhancing APIs</h1>

<p>The three API sets that will make this possible are <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/notifications-of-web-request-and-navigation">Web Request</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/content_scripts.html">Content Scripts</a>, and the <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/proxy%20proposal">Proxy APIs</a>. Our prolific Tor volunteer <a href="http://roberthogan.net/">Robert Hogan</a> has also been doing some work on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=30877">SSL related issues</a> that will prove crucial, as well.</p>

<p>Each of these API sets, however, has its own shortcomings, rough edges, and missing pieces that need to be taken care of before it becomes suitable for us to use. I&#39;ve been spending my time over the past couple months looking over these rough spots, documenting them, and informing Google. I&#39;m also lucky enough to have my brother on the inside: he&#39;s one of the Google Chrome engineers who is working on these very APIs.</p>

<p>With his help, I&#39;ve identified three major stumbling blocks to us and anyone else who is interested in writing security and privacy enhancing extensions on their platform.</p>

<h1>Three Major Stumbling Blocks</h1>

<p>The first major stumbling block is that not only do we need to convince Google that these APIs are useful and needed, but there also has to be a way for them to implement the APIs easily, cleanly, and with very little overhead. Google Chrome is a very fine-tuned high performance browser, and keeping it this way is priority #1 for Google. At the present time, all of the extension APIs are asynchronous, and delivery is optimized so that increasing the number of installed extensions listening for events has negligible to absolutely zero effect on page load time.</p>

<p>However, security and privacy enhancing extensions will need the ability to actually block and modify requests with certainty. This means that fully asynchronous notification and response is not a viable option for some events.</p>

<p>Therefore, last month, I wrote up a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/17ea6efa15bfea0a">review of the Web Request APIs</a>, describing a method that could allow for blocking versions of three of the APIs to function with minimal performance impact, which is the key factor in Google&#39;s decision to provide them.</p>

<p>The second major stumbling block is the fact that none of the Google Extension APIs have yet been used to provide any real added security against any threat model, let alone one as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#adversary">advanced as the one Torbutton employs</a>. Extensions such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/flcpelgcagfhfoegekianiofphddckof?hl=en">KB SSL Enforcer</a> and <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/appearance-functioning/adblock/">Adblock Plus for Chrome</a> do not actually have any security guarantees beyond that which they can get through asynchronous DOM manipulation. There are also magical &quot;special&quot; urls and types of requests that currently are exempt from extension notification or control.</p>

<p>This is a real potential danger for us, and one that we only narrowly dodged with Firefox due only to the significantly more flexibility we have on that platform to reimplement arbitrary browser components, and to use different APIs and observers at different levels of notification. We have learned the hard way over the years that any URLs that go through special codepaths can leave the browser vulnerable to plugin injection, fingerprinting, unmasking, and exploitation.</p>

<p>Because of this, I took the time to write up <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/f5a73572eb040bea">what extensions using the Chrome APIs for security will expect</a>. This includes things like uniform applicability, no functional surprises, and no unilateral exemptions.</p>

<p>The third stumbling block is how Google initially approached Incognito mode and privacy, and extension development in general. The entire extension system is built upon least privilege to ensure security rather than code reviews and audits. Extensions must request permissions to perform classes of actions, and Google is wary of creating permissions that are attractive to (semi-)malicious extensions that want control over everything.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was first believed that no extension should be allowed in Incognito mode, because no assurances could be made about its willingness or ability not to record usage information. This June, my brother finally <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/extensions-in-incognito.html">flipped the switch</a> to allow extensions to be run in Incognito mode, but only with with manual and explicit user approval, after installation.</p>

<p>As such, the behavior of an Incognito-specific extension still has not received a lot of attention at Google. This caused me to write a third post to describe <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/8a46d570807c9a72">how Incognito-specific extensions might function</a>. My hope is that this will help provide another perspective towards extension developers in terms of adding privacy and security to Incognito mode, and to encourage discussions about how to best allow it.</p>

<h1>The Road Ahead</h1>

<p>We&#39;re still many more months away from being able to write a full and working version of Tor Mode, HTTPS Everywhere, or the fingerprint resistance addon, but we&#39;re at least much closer than before, and everything seems to be heading in the right direction, so far.</p>

<p>For those who want to track our progress, as well as Google&#39;s, you can see the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1925">entire list of remaining/important issues</a> on our bugtracker.</p>

          <p><strong>Releases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On August 21st we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.0.10 for GNU/Linux. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1010-gnulinux-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1010-gnulinux-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1010-gnulinux-releas...</a></li>
<li>On August 18, we released Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha. It fixes a big bug in hidden service availability, fixes a variety of other bugs that were preventing performance experiments from moving forward, fixes several bothersome memory leaks, and generally closes a lot of smaller bugs that have been filling up trac lately. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02215-alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02215-alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02215-alpha-released</a></li>
<li>Released two new versions of Orbot, Tor for Android.
&gt; Version 1.0.2
&gt; - added &quot;check&quot; yes/no dialog prompt
&gt; - debugged iptables/transprox settings on Android 1.6 and 2.2
&gt; - added proxy settings help screen and fixed processSettings() NPE
&gt;
&gt; Version 1.0.1
&gt; - found and fixed major bug in per-app trans proxying; list of apps was being cached and iptables rules were not properly updated as the user changed the selection in the list</li>
<li>On August 6, we released Libevent 2.0.6-rc, the first release
candidate of the new Libevent 2.0 series. The main new feature that
we want from Libevent 2.0 is its support for buffer-based (rather than
socket-based) network abstractions, which will let us support Windows the
way it wants to be supported. The new Libevent includes a wide variety of
other features that will make our lives easier too, ranging from making
it easier to support multi-threaded crypto operations to making it easier
to modularly change Tor&#39;s transport from TLS-over-TCP to other options. See <a href="http://levent.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=levent/levent;a=blob;f=ChangeLog;hb=fe008ed656766266b93cdf2083f5b8bc50e6aad3" title="http://levent.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=levent/levent;a=blob;f=ChangeLog;hb=fe008ed656766266b93cdf2083f5b8bc50e6aad3">http://levent.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=levent/levent;a=blob;...</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Funding</strong>
We finished the first year of our NSF grant, and wrote up the annual
(interim) report on what metrics work we&#39;ve done and what research
projects we&#39;ve helped with. We were then awarded the second year of the
two-year grant.</p>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better
tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<p>Continuing research into China&#39;s Great Firewall shows bridges are surviving for 1-2 weeks before being blocked. We&#39;re working to improve the bridge database such that it only gives out bridges that work in a requested country. Right now, we hand out a random selection of 3 bridges regardless of potential country of usage. In China, bridges and relays are still blocked by IP address and TCP port combinations.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture and technical design docs for Tor enhancements
related to blocking-resistance.</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve brainstormed future tasks that need to be done for Tor, broken down
into two sets by upcoming priority:
 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/March2011" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/March2011">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/March201...</a>
and
 <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/June2011" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/June2011">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/sponsors/SponsorD/June2011</a></p>

<p>We wrote up project sketches of how to tackle some of these tasks, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bridge relay images for the cloud. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1853" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1853">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1853</a></li>
<li>Bundling the http request and headers with the initial begin cell, to save a round-trip and improve client preformance. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1849" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1849">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1849</a></li>
<li>A performance experiment to raise the minimum bandwidth for being a relay, thus reducing the overall capacity of the network but improving the average performance of each relay. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1854" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1854">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1854</a></li>
<li>A preliminary design for UDP transport between Tor relays. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1855" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1855">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1855</a></li>
<li>Tor clients should remember bridge relay information and statistics across restarts. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1852" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1852">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1852</a></li>
<li>We should have bridge relays automatically monitor whether they can reach websites like Baidu, to give us early warnings when the bridges become blocked. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1851" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1851">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1851</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Roger met with a researcher from The Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) to discuss Tor, metrics, and analyzing our growing collection of data about the Tor network.</li>
<li>Roger attended the &quot;Workshop on Cyber Security Data for Experimentation&quot; organized by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The premise of the workshop was that many academics need real-world data sets to solve problems, whereas industry is the place with the real-world data sets and they don&#39;t have any real reason to share. By getting the academics and the industry people talking, with government funders nearby, they hoped to better understand the problems and maybe move things forward.
Roger was there (and on the first panel) because of Tor&#39;s work on gathering Tor network snapshots, performance data, and user statistics. Tor&#39;s approach represents one way out of the trap where researchers never quite get the data they want, or if they do it isn&#39;t open enough (which hinders whether anybody else can reproduce their results).

<li>Roger did a talk to a half dozen NSF program managers, to bring them up to speed on what Tor is up to and what sort of measurement and research projects we&#39;re working on and should work on next.

<li>Erinn discussed Tor and free software at DebConf 2010 in New York City. <a href="http://debconf10.debconf.org/" title="http://debconf10.debconf.org/">http://debconf10.debconf.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Andrew and Paul presented at The International Conference on Cyber Security. <a href="http://www.iccs.fordham.edu/" title="http://www.iccs.fordham.edu/">http://www.iccs.fordham.edu/</a>.

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Torbrowser Bundle for GNU/Linux version 1.0.10 released. See above for the details.</li>
<li>Torbrowser Bundle for OSX works on OS X 10.4 and 10.5. 10.6 users continue to experience issues with the launching of the Firefox browser. Erinn and Steven are continuing to debug the 10.6 issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;re developing designs to better handle bridge distribution. Part of this is to enable Tor clients to become bridges and then relays by default. The other part of this is for Tor clients to always have a set of working bridges, requesting new bridges in advance, or be able to track bridge address changes and update accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Accepted Proposal 174 for &quot;Optimistic Data for Tor: Server Side&quot; from Ian Goldberg. This change will save one OP-Exit round trip (down to one from two). There are still two SOCKS Client-OP round trips (negligible time) and two Exit-Server round trips. Depending on the ratio of the Exit-Server (Internet) RTT to the OP-Exit (Tor) RTT, this will decrease the latency by 25 to 50 percent. Experiments validate these predictions. [Goldberg, PETS 2010 rump session; see https://thunk.cs.uwaterloo.ca/optimistic-data-pets2010-rump.pdf] The full proposal can be read at <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/174-optimistic-data-server.txt" title="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob\_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/174-optimistic-data-server.txt">https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposal...</a>.</li>
<li>Mike Perry fixed a number of bugs in the bandwidth authority and exit scanner codebases. The exit scanner codebase is updated with the work of a Google Summer of Code student.</li>
<li>A Google Summer of Code student, Harry Bock, worked on improving the Tor DNSEL codebase. TorDNSEL is a DNSBL-style interface for querying information about Tor exit nodes, to be more thorough, more usable, and more maintainable. Out of this effort came TorBEL, a set of specifications and Python tools that try to address this problem.

          <p>On Friday (Aug 27), I attended the &quot;Workshop on Cyber Security Data for Experimentation&quot; organized by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The premise of the <a href="http://www.gtisc.gatech.edu/nsf_workshop10_agenda.html">workshop</a> was that many academics need real-world data sets to solve problems, whereas industry is the place with the real-world data sets and they don&#39;t have any real reason to share. By getting the academics and the industry people talking, with government funders nearby, they hoped to better understand the problems and maybe move things forward.</p>

<p>I was there (and on the first panel) because of Tor&#39;s work on <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">gathering Tor network snapshots, performance data, and user statistics</a>. Tor&#39;s approach represents one way out of the trap where researchers never quite get the data they want, or if they do it isn&#39;t open enough (which hinders whether anybody else can reproduce their results).</p>

<p>They also asked me to do the wrapup for the workshop. Here are the eight insights that I presented there (with a little bit of commentary from me) -- each of them is a topic that came up during the workshop that I thought warranted more attention.</p>

<p>1) Researchers already have data, it&#39;s just not the data they think they want. Either they need to clean / understand / better analyze what they already have, or they need to figure out where they can gather the data themselves (universities sure have lots of users), or they can turn to organizations like PREDICT (or Tor) that are aggregating data sets for the purpose of making them available for researchers.</p>

<p>Too many data sets from industry come with restrictions. At best you&#39;ll get your data under some sort of bilateral agreement. Whatever happened to public open data that everybody can look at? After all, often you won&#39;t know what you want to look for until you&#39;ve had some time with the data.</p>

<p>We need to better investigate the intersection of &quot;what we can safely gather in an open way&quot; (i.e. without gathering too many personal details) and &quot;what questions we can answer with it&quot; (if you sanitize the data too far, there&#39;s nothing interesting left). I guess the streetlights are brighter over the data sets from antivirus companies, networking companies, etc, so everybody wants to look there. But if it takes multiple years of workshops and everybody&#39;s still frustrated, maybe it&#39;s time to look at other options?</p>

<p>2) Data preservation questions. When a student moves on, it&#39;s common that nobody knows how to continue using what gets left behind. The industry side similarly finds internships too short to be a reliable investment: interns disappear right about the time they start to provide value.</p>

<p>3) Standardized data sets vs specialized data sets. On the one hand, we want standardized public open data sets (think traces for voice recognition), so everybody is doing research from the same starting point. On the other hand, many researchers want to develop specialized data sets to answer new questions -- they find that gathering new data in response to a specific question is a much better strategy. How should we reconcile these conflicting scientific goals?</p>

<p>4) Existing databases need labelling -- for example, if you&#39;re looking at a traffic flow and you want to identify what protocols were in use, you need somebody to annotate it with the ground truth (what protocols actually were in use) or you&#39;ll never know if your algorithms are producing useful answers. Metadata is critical, but it&#39;s expensive to build and maintain. Corporations tend to regard the labelling work as their competitive advantage and keep it to themselves.</p>

<p>5) &quot;Building individual relationships is the only way to get your data.&quot; That was a quote from several people on the academia side, and nobody on the industry side disputed it. If you have to spend a few years interacting with the person who controls the data before you have a chance of seeing it, that sure doesn&#39;t seem to scale well.</p>

<p>6) &quot;The goal of research is not to write papers. It&#39;s to solve problems.&quot; That&#39;s a quote from the industry side. They regard research that&#39;s intellectually interesting as often unrelated to the real-world problems that their company needs to solve. The incentives in academia are structured around publication, and we shouldn&#39;t confuse that with actually solving problems.</p>

<p>7) Internal Review Boards (IRBs) are uniformly not equipped to evaluate this sort of research. They ask questions like whether you&#39;re going to draw blood from your users (and get answers like &quot;not intentionally, ha ha&quot;). At the same time, there are serious legal, ethical, and technical questions that need to be considered for a lot of these data sets -- both in terms of gathering data and in terms of using data. Academics looking at these issues should check out the <a href="http://www.cs.stevens.edu/%7Espock/wecsr2011/">Workshop on the Ethics of Computer Security Research</a>.</p>

<p>8) Both sides took the opportunity to ask NSF for money. Some of the academics suggested that NSF could help to cover the cost of interns (one of the most successful ways to get industry data these days is to send one of your students as a &quot;data envoy&quot; for the summer; but as industry research groups tighten their budgets, competition for the remaining slots is increasingly fierce). The industry representatives on the other hand reiterated several times how much more cooperative they could be if somebody gave their shareholders a reason to look at sharing data as anything more than a risk.</p>

<p>Going back to the Tor perspective, there were also some good lessons to be learned from Doug Maughan&#39;s lunchtime talk. (Doug was the program manager for the DARPA program that funded Tor back in 2002-2003.) Doug has been coordinating a group called <a href="https://www.predict.org/">PREDICT</a>, which aggregates network operations data sets for security researchers. Despite having many terabytes of data, they&#39;re not getting much traction in the research world. Is it because they haven&#39;t done a good job marketing what they can offer? Do they need forums to build a community around their data? Do they not have the right data yet? Tor&#39;s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">metrics and data</a> project will be re-encountering these lessons in the coming years, so we should keep an eye on PREDICT.</p>

<p>As a final note, one of the NSF program managers found me afterwards and said that NSF should fund an EAGER (a small two-year grant) to combine a data-mining expert with the Tor data and see what insights can be extracted from it. If you are that data-mining expert, please contact us.</p>
