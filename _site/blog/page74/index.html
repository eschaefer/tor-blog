        <div class="post-description">
          <p>I was invited to speak at the annual technical conference of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, <a href="http://nnedv.org/" title="http://nnedv.org/">http://nnedv.org/</a>. Over the past few years, I&#39;ve been personally involved with helping victims and survivors of abuse. In many cases, it has been education and helping them understand what&#39;s possible on the Internet, methods to protect their privacy, and methods to control what data trails they leave behind. I&#39;ve been deeply disturbed after meeting survivors of sexual slavery, human trafficking, and child abuse. The realities of life for these people while they were being abused, and the systematic failures of the systems set up to protect and help them, is shocking. The law enforcement officers and those offering services and direct support to these victims often suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Everyone involved with the results of abuse seems to need help all around.</p>

<p>Many people simply assume that the only answer is to disconnect and never go online again. However, often your data is online, even if you are not. Many services, friends, and access to information is increasingly available online only. Disconnecting isn&#39;t really an option, especially if you need to find support, shelter, and services to help you. Conversely, if you&#39;re a survivor, part of the healing process is to help others. The ability to go online anonymously and join forums, chat, or email with others in a bad place can be the difference between life and death. This is also true for those in law enforcement and support services. They need to share with people, heal and be healed. In many cases, they don&#39;t want this associated to anything a search engine, future employer, or current partners will find. They cherish their anonymity.</p>

<p>I did two presentations, the first was loosely about cloud computing, centralized reporting, and putting your victim&#39;s and survivor&#39;s data online. The core idea was to transfer knowledge, not recommend any one product or solution. I believe people can better assess risks when they understand the data to support their decisions. This presentation is here, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgrani...</a>.</p>

<p>The second presentation was more about Tor and how survivors and victims can and have used Tor in the past to regain some control of their online privacy and anonymity. This second presentation is here, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-S...</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad NNEDV exists, and that we can help, even if in some small way, such as doing a couple of presentations.</p>

          <p>There is a growing cacophony that a fully identified, real name policy for the Internet will solve all of our problems relating to crime, bullying, harassment, and everything else. This idea is furthered along by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/randi-zuckerberg-anonymity-online_n_910892.html">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/10/eric-schmidt-privacy-stan_n_677224.html">Google</a>, and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/06/25/national-strategy-trusted-identities-cyberspace">US White House</a>.</p>

<p>As just one example of how this is an over-simplified argument, it seems people are continuing to forget their childhoods. As a kid, many of you were bullied and harassed at school. You knew the kids picking on you at lunch, at recess, at morning before class, and after school. Further, you knew their parents, where they lived, and generally who they were outside of school. This bullying and harassment may have continued through High School, into College, and through your work life. Again, you knew their real names and far more about them than Google, Facebook, or the US Govt will ever hope to know. A real name world hasn&#39;t made life better, more civil, or safer for millions of kids growing up in it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent time talking to kids that have been bullied online and in real life. It&#39;s all done with real names via Facebook, text messaging, at recess, after school, via twitter, etc. It spreads to those trying to stop it, such as their parents who get involved to defend their kid. These are all real name environments. Kids don&#39;t call it bullying. It&#39;s called &#39;starting static&#39; these days to skirt the word &#39;bullying&#39;. Regardless of the term, it&#39;s frequently done via real names.</p>

<p>There is a small, but growing, set of voices realizing that real name policies aren&#39;t all they are promising to provide, namely safety. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms">EFF/Jillian York</a>, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/07/25/google-and-the-loss-of-online-anonymity/">GigOM/Matthew Ingram</a>, and <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/4chan-founder-moot-anonymity-authenticity-zuc">moot</a> have all made cases why anonymity is important on the Internet. This forced dichotomy is not new, <a href="http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/6095/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html">Karina Rigby</a> wrote about it back in 1995.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve learned over the past few years that the ability to remain anonymous has led to people instituting positive change, such as the &#39;Arab Spring&#39;, and to being able to research and question authority without the fear of punishment and/or death to them and their relatives in repressive regimes. Further, the option of anonymity can allow you to explore new topics, learn about new things, and join new communities. You are freed from the baggage of your own history. People can change.</p>

<p>Jerks can use anonymity too. Or they can use their real names. It would be an interesting study to see the abuse/complaint report numbers for Facebook, Google+, and other real name environments versus similar environments without such a real name requirement. It would be equally interesting to learn if the presence of an authority figure versus real names provides less abuse/complaints from the members. This post is skipping the entire topic of trojan software acting in your name, such as botnets collating millions of identities to do the bidding of others.</p>

<p>The power is in the beholder, not the technology itself. Use your anonymity for good, while you still have it. You should be in control of your identity, not someone else.</p>

          <p>Hi all. A new release of <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">arm</a> is now available. This completes the codebase refactoring project that&#39;s been a year in the works and provides numerous performance, usability, and stability improvements...</p>

<ul>
<li>Relay Setup Wizard</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting up a relay can be tricky for new users. In headless environments this means navigating Tor&#39;s massive, user unfriendly man page and even when Vidalia&#39;s an option it makes relatively poor exit configurations. Starting arm before Tor now provides instructions for auto-generating a good relay setup...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard1.png">Selection for what you&#39;d like to be</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard2.png">Picking your relay options</a></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_wizard3.png">Confirmation for the configuration it&#39;s making</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Menu Interface</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All of arm&#39;s capabilities are now available via a <a href="http://www.atagar.com/transfer/tmp/arm_menu.png">simple menu interface</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Arm Gui Prototype</li>
</ul>

<p>Over this summer Kamran Khan has been <a href="http://inspirated.com/2011/06/28/summer-of-code-progress-graphs-logs-and-acid">working on a GTK frontend</a> for arm as part of Google Summer of Code. The initial prototype is ready!</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance Improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Several arm and TorCtl performance fixes providing a 83% faster startup time, 12% lower memory usage, and instantaneous shutdown.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved Platform Support</li>
</ul>

<p>Vastly better support for Mac OSX. Arm has also been <a href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze-backports/tor-arm">backported to Debian Squeeze</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/maverick-backports/+bug/721886">Ubuntu Lucid / Maverick</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>... etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Options for requesting a new identity, shutting down Tor, reconnecting if Tor&#39;s been restarted and <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/releaseNotes.php#1.4.3">many, many bugfixes</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers! -Damian</p>

          <p>Tor 0.2.2.30-rc is the first release candidate for the Tor 0.2.2.x
series. It fixes a few smaller bugs, but generally appears stable.
Please test it and let us know whether it is!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.30-rc - 2011-07-07</strong>
<strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Send a SUCCEEDED stream event to the controller when a reverse
resolve succeeded. Fixes bug 3536; bugfix on 0.0.8pre1. Issue
discovered by katmagic.</li>
<li>Always NUL-terminate the sun_path field of a sockaddr_un before
passing it to the kernel. (Not a security issue: kernels are
smart enough to reject bad sockaddr_uns.) Found by Coverity;
CID #428. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t stack-allocate the list of supplementary GIDs when we&#39;re
about to log them. Stack-allocating NGROUPS_MAX gid_t elements
could take up to 256K, which is way too much stack. Found by
Coverity; CID #450. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.</li>
<li>Add BUILDTIMEOUT_SET to the list returned by the &#39;GETINFO
events/names&#39; control-port command. Bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha;
fixes part of bug 3465.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak when receiving a descriptor for a hidden
service we didn&#39;t ask for. Found by Coverity; CID #30. Bugfix
on 0.2.2.26-beta.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Update to the July 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
