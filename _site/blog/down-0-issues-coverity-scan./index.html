<p class="meta">11 Jan 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>As of 7 January, we&#39;re down to 0 issues on Coverity Scan. This is great news!</p>

<p>In case you haven&#39;t heard of them, Coverity makes top-of-the-line static analysis tools (programs that analyse other programs looking for possible bugs). They&#39;re a big serious company, with a serious &quot;enterprise&quot; pricing structure. But, fortunately to us, they have <a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">a program</a> to provide the use of these tools, free of charge, to selected open source projects. They&#39;ve been scanning development snapshots of Tor for bugs since last September.</p>

<p>In September, they found 171 issues in our code. Many of these were just sloppiness in our unit tests&#39; error handing, but a good fraction were real bugs in our main codebase, a couple of which could have resulted in crashes under unusual circumstances that probably would have been hard to debug. By December, we were down to 15 issues. Now we&#39;re at 0, at long last.</p>

<p>Congratulations and thanks to everybody who helped analyse and fix the bugs here, and many thanks to the administrators of Coverity Scan for helping us out.</p>
