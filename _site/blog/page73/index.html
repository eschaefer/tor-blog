	      <p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to announce that Vidalia-0.2.14 is out, and yes 0.2.13 is too
(the changelog will clarify why two releases).</p>

<p>If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve Vidalia, please
remember to go to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/" title="https://trac.torproject.org/">https://trac.torproject.org/</a> and file a ticket for it!</p>

<p>You can find the tarball for this release here:
 <a href="https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.14.tar.gz" title="https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.14.tar.gz">https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.1...</a>
 <a href="https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.14.tar.gz.asc" title="https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.14.tar.gz.asc">https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.1...</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p>

<p><strong>0.2.14 26-Aug-2011</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make the AutoPort setting default to false, so that it doesn&#39;t
break backwards compatibility for people that aren&#39;t using Vidalia
inside Tor Browser Bundle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>0.2.13 10-Aug-2011</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add a way to bootstrap Tor&#39;s torrc file (copy the torrc to a given
directory before Vidalia starts) so that packages such as
Bridge-by-default portable bundles for OSX don&#39;t violate the directory
structure of the operating system. Fixes bug 2821.</li>
<li>Add the proper CA Certificates so that the &quot;Find Bridges&quot; button works
again. Fixes bug 2835.</li>
<li>Update the useful links help page. Fixes bug 2809.</li>
<li>Reintegrate Breakpad, and make it available in platforms other than
Windows. Resolves bug 2105.</li>
<li>Fix bandwidth assigned to relays on the Network Map. A lot of relays are
displaying an erroneous bandwidth and since they are ordered by that
value in the Network Map, it leads to confusion. Vidalia now specifies
the bandwidth as the minimum of the three possible values (burst,
average and observed). Fixes bug 2744.</li>
<li>Fix layouts in the configuration panel to make them look seamlessly
across all platforms.</li>
<li>Add -no-remote parameter to Firefox so it allows another instance of
non-TBB Firefox. Fixes bug 2254.</li>
<li>Add the possibility of changing the torrc path while Tor hasn&#39;t
started. Fixes bug 3109.</li>
<li>Make the fact that bridges don&#39;t need a DirPort setting more clear by
removing the content of the field when disabling it. Fixes bug 3119.</li>
<li>Improve command line parameter handling. Resolves bug 2965.</li>
<li>Fix layout in BandwidthGraph to display labels correctly in every
language. Fixes bug 2500.</li>
<li>Updates README.debs to reflect the change in the packaging now that
Vidalia uses Git. Fixes bug 3668.</li>
<li>Add a way to use the autoconfiguration for ControlPort and SocksPort.
Tor can now autoconfigure Control and Socks Ports when the default ones
are in use. This makes it easier to run several different instances of
TBB at the same time. Resolves bug 3077.</li>
<li>Provide the necessary fields (Control password, ControlPort) to let
TorButton NEWNYM. Vidalia provides these in env vars when it launches
the Firefox instance. Resolves bug 2659.</li>
</ul>

	      <p>Tor&#39;s <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards">entry guard design</a> protects users in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>First, they protect against the &quot; <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#Wright:2004">predecessor attack</a>&quot;: if you choose new relays for each circuit, eventually an attacker who runs a few relays will be your first and last hop. With entry guards, the risk of end-to-end correlation for any given circuit is the same, but the cumulative risk for all your circuits over time is capped.</p>

<p>Second, they help to protect against the &quot; <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs07-doa">denial of service as denial of anonymity</a>&quot; attack, where an attacker who runs quite a few relays fails any circuit that he&#39;s a part of and that he can&#39;t win against, forcing Alice (the user) to generate more circuits and thus increasing the overall chance that the attacker wins. Entry guards greatly reduce the risk, since Alice will never choose outside of a few nodes for her first hop.</p>

<p>Third, entry guards raise the startup cost to an adversary who runs relays in order to trace users. Without entry guards, the attacker can sign up some relays and immediately start having chances to observe Alice&#39;s circuits. With them, new adversarial relays won&#39;t have the Guard flag so won&#39;t be chosen as the first hop of any circuit; and even once they earn the Guard flag, users who have already chosen guards won&#39;t switch away from their current guards for quite a while.</p>

<p>But how long exactly? The first research question here examines vulnerability due to natural churn of entry guards. Consider an adversary who runs one entry guard with advertised capacity C. Alice maintains an ordered list of guards (chosen at random, weighted by advertised speed, from the whole list of possible guards). For each circuit, she chooses her first hop (uniformly at random) from the first G guards from her list that are currently running (appending a new guard to the list as needed, but going back to earlier guards if they reappear). How long until Alice adds the adversary&#39;s node to her guard list? You can use the uptime data from the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html">directory archives</a>, either to build a model for guard churn or just to use the churn data directly. Assuming G=3, how do the results vary by C? What&#39;s the variance?</p>

<p>Research question two: consider intentional churn due to load balancing too. Alice actually discards each guard between 30 and 60 days (uniformly chosen) after she first picks it. This intentional turnover prevents long-running guards from accumulating more and more users and getting overloaded. Another way of looking at it is that it shifts load to new guards so we can make better use of them. How much does this additional churn factor impact your answer from step one above? Or asked a different way, what fraction of Alice&#39;s vulnerability to the adversary&#39;s entry guard comes from natural churn, and what fraction from the proactive expiration? How does the answer change for different expiry intervals (e.g. between 10 and 30 days, or between 60 and 90)?</p>

<p>Research question three: how do these answers change as we vary G? Right now we choose from among the first three guards, to reduce the variance of expected user performance -- if we always picked the first guard on the list, and some users picked a low-capacity or highly-congested relay, none of that user&#39;s circuits would perform well. That said, if choosing G=1 is a huge win for security, we should work on other ways to reduce variance.</p>

<p>Research question four: how would these answers change if we make the cutoffs for getting the Guard flag more liberal, and/or change how we choose what nodes become guards? After all, Tor&#39;s anonymity is based on the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network">diversity of entry and exit points</a>, and while it may be tough to get around exit relay scarcity, my theory is that our artificial entry point scarcity (because our requirements are overly strict) is needlessly hurting the anonymity Tor can offer.</p>

<p>Our current algorithm for guard selection has three requirements:
1) The relay needs to have first appeared longer ago than 12.5% of the relays, or 8 days ago, whichever is shorter.
2) The relay needs to advertise at least the median bandwidth in the network, or 250KB/s, whichever is smaller.
3) The relay needs to have at least the median weighted-fractional-uptime of relays in the network, or 98% WFU, whichever is smaller. (For WFU, the clock starts ticking when we first hear about the relay; we track the percentage of that time the relay has been up, discounting values by 95% every 12 hours.)</p>

<p>Today&#39;s guard cutoffs in practice are &quot;was first sighted at least 8 days ago, advertises 100KB/s of bandwidth, and has 98% WFU.&quot;</p>

<p>Consider two relays, A and B. Relay A first appeared 30 days ago, disappeared for a week, and has been consistently up since then. It has a WFU (after decay, give or take a fencepost) of 786460 seconds / 824195 = 95.4%, so it&#39;s not a guard. Relay B appeared two weeks ago and has been up since then. Its WFU is 658517 / 658517 = 100%, so it gets the Guard flag -- even though it has less uptime, and even less weighted uptime. Based on the answers to the first three research questions, which relay would serve Alice best as a guard?</p>

<p>The big-picture tradeoff to explore is: what algorithm should we use to assign Guard flags such that a) we assign the flag to as many relays as possible, yet b) we minimize the chance that Alice will use the adversary&#39;s node as a guard?</p>

	      <p>What do you use Tor for? Why do you need it? What has Tor done for you? We need your stories.</p>

<p>We have plenty of practice explaining how Tor works, from technical specifications, design documents, academic papers, and popular presentation. And of course, the code is all open-source.</p>

<p>But explaining why Tor is important is more of a challenge. We can speak in the abstract about the importance of free speech and privacy on the internet, but no abstract statement is quite so persuasive as a real-world example.</p>

<p>We know these examples are out there. We regularly hear from vulnerable populations and people who need to cope with surveillance. We are approached by people who need Tor to stay safe at work, whether they are going after criminals on behalf of their governments, or going after the criminals who run their governments, or just regular people trying to preserve their privacy.</p>

<p>But naturally, most of these stories are ones that we don&#39;t have permission to share. After all, it would hardly be in keeping with our pro-privacy beliefs to publish tech-support requests!</p>

<p>Similarly, because we don&#39;t gather sensitive data on our network, we cannot (as some networks do) publish regular reports on what kinds of uses we are seeing. (We do not collect this data because we believe that a privacy network should put privacy foremost, and that the best way to protect people&#39;s information is not to collect it in the first place.) This is fantastic when it comes to protecting users against advertisers, censors, miscellaneous snoops, and the secret police of authoritarian regimes. But it isn&#39;t working out so well when we are asked by donors and other potential allies who want to know what supporting Tor means in less technical terms.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we work on Tor because everybody has the right to their own voice. So while this is on the one hand a plea for information we can use to tell the world about the importance of what we&#39;re accomplishing (and try to get donations to do more of it), it&#39;s also a request born of the notion that nobody is more qualified to tell your own story than you are.</p>

<p>So, please send us your stories so we can share them with the world. If email works, you can send it to <a href="mailto:tor-assistants@torproject.org">tor-assistants@torproject.org</a>, subject line &quot;Why I Use Tor&quot;. And of course, you can just post a comment here.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t use names, but if too many details can reveal who you are, please err on the side of caution. There is no point in responding to our request if it puts you in danger. That said: why do you use Tor? Whether you use it to look at <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/03/08/the-cute-cat-theory-talk-at-etech/">cute cats</a> or political blogs, we&#39;d like to know. And since we designed Tor with privacy in mind, we can&#39;t know unless you tell us.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
