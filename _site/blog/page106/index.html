          <p><strong>New releases, new hires, new funding</strong></p>

<p>Bruce Leidl joins to work on developing Tor in Java. Bruce will write a fully functional Tor in Java in order to provide a solid foundation for other java-based projects; such as Tor on mobile platforms like Maemo and Android.</p>

<p>On November 2nd we released Vidalia 0.2.6. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-026-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-026-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-026-released</a></p>

<p>On November 20th, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.10. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1210-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1210-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-1210-released</a></p>

<p>On November 19th, we released Tor 0.2.2.6-alpha. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0226-alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0226-alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0226-alpha-released</a></p>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make
Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<p>Roger met with his class at KAIST working on bridge deployment strategies. A few teams developed some creative strategies. Roger is continuing to work with the leading teams to further refine their ideas before publishing.</p>

<p>Improved our email autoresponder, get-tor, to handle non-english character sets. Implemented gettor+(language)@ addressing to allow users to request tor browser bundle packages in their native language. Added support for languages with a right to left orientation, such as farsi.</p>

<p><strong>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Andrew spoke at CASCON 2009 about Tor and its research. A few researchers from IBM and University of Waterloo were interested in furthering research. <a href="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/" title="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/">https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/</a></li>
<li>Andrew and Roger attended Blogfest Asia 2009, HK BloggerCon, and the Privacy and Security Workshop series in Hong Kong and met with many bloggers, activists, and media people from all over Asia. Andrew wrote up his experiences at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/blogfest-asia-2009" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/blogfest-asia-2009">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/blogfest-asia-2009</a>.</li>
<li>Jacob spoke at Internet Dagarna 2009 in Stockholm, Sweden. <a href="http://www.internetdagarna.se/" title="http://www.internetdagarna.se/">http://www.internetdagarna.se/</a></li>
<li>Jacob spoke at SUNET gathering in Stockholm, Sweden.</li>
<li>Jacob helped organize and run Hackers Conference in California. <a href="http://www.think.org/conference/" title="http://www.think.org/conference/">http://www.think.org/conference/</a></li>
<li>Karen met with National Iranian-American Council, <a href="http://www.niacouncil.org/" title="http://www.niacouncil.org/">http://www.niacouncil.org/</a>, to discuss ways Tor can help NIAC succeed in helping improve Human Rights and Democracy in Iran.</li>
<li>Andrew had a conversation with Freedom House which resulted in some instructional videos being produced to help users install and configure Tor. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/installing-and-using-tor" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/installing-and-using-tor">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/installing-and-using-tor</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong>
We distributed bridge addresses to networks of people in China and Iran to let Tor users continue to work without issues.</p>

<p>Karsten worked to remove sensitive data from collected meta-data about bridges. We can publish our bridge data archives to <a href="http://archive.torproject.org" title="http://archive.torproject.org">http://archive.torproject.org</a> soon. This data could help understand bridge quantity, usage of bridges around the world, and other information from possible data analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<p>Included in the Tor 0.2.2.6-alpha release is the beginning of microdescriptors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Directory authorities can now agree on and publish small summaries of router information that clients can use in place of regular server descriptors. This transition will eventually allow clients to use far less bandwidth for downloading information about the network. Begins the implementation of Proposal 158: ”Clients
download consensus + microdescriptors”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>Continuing to update the email autoresponder, get-tor, to handle split downloads on request. Split Tor Browser Bundles work well. Creation and maintenance of Mac OS X split dmgs is due in December 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Translation work, ultimately a browser-based approach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pushed live Runa’s work on integrating the website to our translation portal, <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/" title="https://translation.torproject.org/">https://translation.torproject.org/</a>.</li>
<li>Runa fine tuned the translation portal to website scripts.</li>
<li>Runa updated the documentation for translators to reflect these tor translation portal updates.</li>
<li>Added our email autoresponder, get-tor, to the translation portal.</li>
<li>Began live testing of website translations through the Tor Translation Portal.</li>
<li>28 updated Polish website translations.</li>
<li>15 updated Chinese website translations.</li>
<li>11 updated Italian website translations.</li>
<li>1 French translation of get-tor.</li>
<li>Full Norwegian translation of tor browser bundle.</li>
<li>Full Norwegian translation of the website.</li>
<li>Full Burmese translation of the website.</li>
<li>Full Burmese translation of torcheck.</li>
<li>Updated Spanish torbutton translations.</li>
<li>Updated Chinese torbutton translations.</li>
<li>Updated Chinese torcheck translations.</li>
<li>18 updated German website translations.</li>

          <p>Congratulations to Chrisd for assuming maintainership of the Polipo codebase from Juliusz. The full announcement is available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=87d42l7fka.fsf%40trurl.pps.jussieu.fr&amp;forum_name=polipo-users">the mailing list archives</a>.</p>

<p><em>Why Chris?</em></p>

<p>Chrisd was a 2009 Google Summer of Code for Tor/EFF. His project was <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/polipo-portability-enhancements-summary">Polipo Portability Enhancements</a>. Chris has proven himself to be a very competent coder and able to design and implement features as needed. He even wrote a SOCKS layer fix for Firefox bugs, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=280661">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661</a>.</p>

<p><em>What does this mean to Tor?</em></p>

<p>It means we have a fantastic new coder maintaining the polipo codebase. Bugfixes, features, and more frequent releases should help improve polipo beyond where it is today.</p>

<p><em>Is Tor going to control Polipo?</em></p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to influence Chris on the direction of Polipo, but provide him support, volunteers, and an infrastructure to let him do what he needs to do. Juliusz created polipo and got it off to a great start. We&#39;re going to support Chris in continuing the progress. The world still wants an http proxy that&#39;s modern, fast, and flexible. Privoxy is a fine alternative to polipo, perhaps the two projects can come together.</p>

<p><em>What&#39;s happening to Juliusz?</em></p>

<p>Juliusz is a busy person. His free time has been concentrated on Babel, <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/%7Ejch/software/babel/" title="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/babel/">http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/babel/</a>, over the past year. Juliusz is still a committer to polipo. We appreciate all of his help during the transition and for the years of maintenance of polipo.</p>

          <p>On November 19, we released the latest in the Tor alpha series, version 0.2.2.6-alpha. This release lays the groundwork for many upcoming features:
support for the new lower-footprint &quot;microdescriptor&quot; directory design,
future-proofing our consensus format against new hash functions or
other changes, and an Android port. It also makes Tor compatible with
the upcoming OpenSSL 0.9.8l release, and fixes a variety of bugs.</p>

<p>It can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en</a></p>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Directory authorities can now create, vote on, and serve multiple
parallel formats of directory data as part of their voting process.
Partially implements Proposal 162: &quot;Publish the consensus in
multiple flavors&quot;.</li>
<li>Directory authorities can now agree on and publish small summaries
of router information that clients can use in place of regular
server descriptors. This transition will eventually allow clients
to use far less bandwidth for downloading information about the
network. Begins the implementation of Proposal 158: &quot;Clients
download consensus + microdescriptors&quot;.</li>
<li>The directory voting system is now extensible to use multiple hash
algorithms for signatures and resource selection. Newer formats
are signed with SHA256, with a possibility for moving to a better
hash algorithm in the future.</li>
<li>New DisableAllSwap option. If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all
current and future memory pages via mlockall(). On supported
platforms (modern Linux and probably BSD but not Windows or OS X),
this should effectively disable any and all attempts to page out
memory. This option requires that you start your Tor as root --
if you use DisableAllSwap, please consider using the User option
to properly reduce the privileges of your Tor.</li>
<li>Numerous changes, bugfixes, and workarounds from Nathan Freitas
to help Tor build correctly for Android phones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Work around a security feature in OpenSSL 0.9.8l that prevents our
handshake from working unless we explicitly tell OpenSSL that we
are using SSL renegotiation safely. We are, but OpenSSL 0.9.8l
won&#39;t work unless we say we are.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a crash bug when trying to initialize the evdns module in
Libevent 2. Bugfix on 0.2.1.16-rc.</li>
<li>Stop logging at severity &#39;warn&#39; when some other Tor client tries
to establish a circuit with us using weak DH keys. It&#39;s a protocol
violation, but that doesn&#39;t mean ordinary users need to hear about
it. Fixes the bug part of bug 1114. Bugfix on 0.1.0.13.</li>
<li>Do not refuse to learn about authority certs and v2 networkstatus
documents that are older than the latest consensus. This bug might
have degraded client bootstrapping. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
Spotted and fixed by xmux.</li>
<li>Fix numerous small code-flaws found by Coverity Scan Rung 3.</li>
<li>If all authorities restart at once right before a consensus vote,
nobody will vote about &quot;Running&quot;, and clients will get a consensus
with no usable relays. Instead, authorities refuse to build a
consensus if this happens. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 1066.</li>
<li>If your relay can&#39;t keep up with the number of incoming create
cells, it would log one warning per failure into your logs. Limit
warnings to 1 per minute. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre10; fixes bug 1042.</li>
<li>Bridges now use &quot;reject *:*&quot; as their default exit policy. Bugfix
on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1113.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak on directory authorities during voting that was
introduced in 0.2.2.1-alpha. Found via valgrind.</li>
</ul>

          <p>I had a conversation with a private donor from Europe yesterday. During the discussion, I asked,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there more we can do in the EU to help protect privacy and anonymity online?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are already doing it as far as I am concerned: I started using TOR due to the recent coming into force of the legal requirement that UK ISPs must keep all web-browsing and e-mail connections for a year (?), and the fact that practically everyone and his cat (in government, of course) can ask to see those records without judicial review. Maybe you should stop talking about China and Tibet as places where anonymity are needed by journalists, and talk about the EU were anonymity is needed by all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We continued to discuss the surveillance society that is the UK, and how the UK government is happy to export it to the rest of Europe. Governments are also large and complex. Many times one part of the government proposes and starts to roll out some policy or law, only to have another branch work to stop it. An unrelated, but classic example of this is,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, you are right about your characterization of governmental organizations; just look at this link and try not to laugh too loudly:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8379759.stm" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk\_news/politics/8379759.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8379759.stm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s great to hear from normal people that they are concerned about what is going on in their country. And that they are taking both tacts of supporting technological and political organizations that are working to address these laws. Not everyone has to be an activist to care about what&#39;s happening to the Internet.</p>

<p>There are groups like the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a> and <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a> tackling these issues on a political level. <a href="http://effi.org/">EFFi</a> in Finland, <a href="http://bof.nl/">Bits of Freedom</a> in the Netherlands, and the <a href="http://ccc.de/">CCC</a> in Germany are other fine organizations working to stop or limit the creeping Internet surveillance.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, we started looking for a new hosting location for a directory authority <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/time-directory-authority-outside-useu">outside the US and EU</a>. After talking to a few ISPs, <a href="http://www.shinjiru.com/">Shinjiru Technology</a> donated a high-bandwidth server to us. The server has been up and running for a few months now without issues. The staff has been great to work with and we&#39;ll soon turn this into a public directory authority for the public Tor Network.
This is a public thank you to Shinjiru for supporting online privacy and anonymity with Tor.</p>
