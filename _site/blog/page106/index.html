          <p>On October 10, we released Tor version 0.2.2.4-alpha.</p>

<p>This release can be found at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/">https://www.torproject.org/download/</a></p>

<p>It contains the following:
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix several more asserts in the circuit_build_times code, for
example one that causes Tor to fail to start once we have
accumulated 5000 build times in the state file. Bugfixes on
0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes bug 1108.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Move moria1 and Tonga to alternate IP addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Log SSL state transitions at debug level during handshake, and
include SSL states in error messages. This may help debug future
SSL handshake issues.</li>
<li>Add a new &quot;Handshake&quot; log domain for activities that happen
during the TLS handshake.</li>
<li>Revert to the &quot;June 3 2009&quot; ip-to-country file. The September one
seems to have removed most US IP addresses.</li>
<li>Directory authorities now reject Tor relays with versions less than
0.1.2.14. This step cuts out four relays from the current network,
none of which are very big.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a couple of smaller issues with gathering statistics. Bugfixes
on 0.2.2.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix two memory leaks in the error case of
circuit_build_times_parse_state. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t count one-hop circuits when we&#39;re estimating how long it
takes circuits to build on average. Otherwise we&#39;ll set our circuit
build timeout lower than we should. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</li>
<li>Directory authorities no longer change their opinion of, or vote on,
whether a router is Running, unless they have themselves been
online long enough to have some idea. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha.
Fixes bug 1023.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Revise our unit tests to use the &quot;tinytest&quot; framework, so we
can run tests in their own processes, have smarter setup/teardown
code, and so on. The unit test code has moved to its own
subdirectory, and has been split into multiple modules.</li>
</ul>

          <p>On September 21st, we released Tor version 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tor now tracks how long it takes to build client-side circuits
over time, and adapts its timeout to local network performance.
Since a circuit that takes a long time to build will also provide
bad performance, we get significant latency improvements by
discarding the slowest 20% of circuits. Specifically, Tor creates
circuits more aggressively than usual until it has enough data
points for a good timeout estimate. Implements proposal 151.
We are especially looking for reports (good and bad) from users with
both EDGE and broadband connections that can move from broadband
to EDGE and find out if the build-time data in the .tor/state gets
reset without loss of Tor usability. You should also see a notice
log message telling you that Tor has reset its timeout.</li>
<li>Directory authorities can now vote on arbitary integer values as
part of the consensus process. This is designed to help set
network-wide parameters. Implements proposal 167.</li>
<li>Tor now reads the &quot;circwindow&quot; parameter out of the consensus,
and uses that value for its circuit package window rather than the
default of 1000 cells. Begins the implementation of proposal 168.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a remotely triggerable memory leak when a consensus document
contains more than one signature from the same voter. Bugfix on
0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix an extremely rare infinite recursion bug that could occur if
we tried to log a message after shutting down the log subsystem.
Found by Matt Edman. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix parsing for memory or time units given without a space between
the number and the unit. Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1076.</li>
<li>A networkstatus vote must contain exactly one signature. Spec
conformance issue. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix an obscure bug where hidden services on 64-bit big-endian
systems might mis-read the timestamp in v3 introduce cells, and
refuse to connect back to the client. Discovered by &quot;rotor&quot;.
Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>We were triggering a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever
we connect via the v2 connection protocol to any relay that has
a wrong clock. Instead, we should only inform the controller when
it&#39;s a trusted authority that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix
on 0.2.0.20-rc; starts to fix bug 1074. Reported by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>We were telling the controller about CHECKING_REACHABILITY and
REACHABILITY_FAILED status events whenever we launch a testing
circuit or notice that one has failed. Instead, only tell the
controller when we want to inform the user of overall success or
overall failure. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha. Fixes bug 1075. Reported
by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn when we&#39;re using a circuit that ends with a node
excluded in ExcludeExitNodes, but the circuit is not used to access
the outside world. This should help fix bug 1090, but more problems
remain. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Work around a small memory leak in some versions of OpenSSL that
stopped the memory used by the hostname TLS extension from being
freed.</li>
<li>Make our &#39;torify&#39; script more portable; if we have only one of
&#39;torsocks&#39; or &#39;tsocks&#39; installed, don&#39;t complain to the user;
and explain our warning about tsocks better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;getinfo status/accepted-server-descriptor&quot; controller
command, which is the recommended way for controllers to learn
whether our server descriptor has been successfully received by at
least on directory authority. Un-recommend good-server-descriptor
getinfo and status events until we have a better design for them.</li>
<li>Update to the &quot;September 4 2009&quot; ip-to-country file.</li>
</ul>

          <p>Here&#39;s what the Tor Project accomplished in September 2009.</p>

<p><strong>New Hires</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Carolyn Anhalt is our new Translation and Community Manager. Carolyn has years of experience managing and growing content translation, as well as wrangling online communities and developing volunteer moderators and support roles from the community. She’s fluent or conversant in a number of languages, such as: Russian, French, English, German, Italian, and Welsh. Carolyn’s initial goals are to grow the translator community to keep everything Tor translated, work out better translation tools for translators, and to generally assist translators.</li>
<li>Karen Reilly joins us as our Development Director. Karen has years of experience in growing both community-based and foundation-based funding, as well as helping to fulfill the mission of organizations through outreach and community-building. Karen’s initial goals are to further develop community funding, work with our current donors, help create an annual report, and expand Tor’s outreach efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Funding</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tor and Drexel University receive a grant from the National Science Foundation to research “Privacy-preserving measurements of the Tor network to improve performance and anonymity”.</li>
<li>Tor and ITT receive a grant from the Naval Research Laboratory to research “Tor Networks Trust-Based Routing Research &amp; Design Support”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Releases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On September 23rd, we released Tor version 0.2.2.3-alpha. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0223alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0223alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0223alpha-released</a></li>
<li>On September 21, we released Tor version 0.2.2.2-alpha. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0222alpha-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0222alpha-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0222alpha-released</a></li>
<li>On September 7, we released Vidalia 0.2.4. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-024-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-024-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-024-released</a></li>
<li>On September 11, we released Tor Browser Bundle version 1.2.9. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make
Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jacob Appelbaum and Nathan Frietas developed a fully functional Tor for the Android mobile operating system. It is currently being tested before being released to the Android Marketplace. This Android application uses mainline Tor as written in C, rather than porting/creating a Tor client in Java. Others have started discussions and coding around using Java to create a Tor-compatible client. A new mailing list was created to encourage this community to grow, <a href="http://archives.seul.org/tor/java/" title="http://archives.seul.org/tor/java/">http://archives.seul.org/tor/java/</a>.</li>
<li>Damian Johnson further developed arm, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/arm/trunk/" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/arm/trunk/">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/arm/trunk/</a>. Arm is a command line application for monitoring Tor relays, providing real time status information such as the current configuration, bandwidth usage, message log, connections, etc. This uses a curses interface much like ’top’ does for system usage. The application is intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone stuck with a tty terminal for checking their relay’s status.</li>
<li>Added two new Tor website and software distribution mirrors. Update list of current mirrors to reflect their current status of how current the mirrors are compared to the main torproject.org website.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Architecture and technical design docs for Tor enhancements
related to blocking-resistance.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A paper entitled, “On the risks of serving whenever you surf: Vulnerabilities in Tor’s blocking resistance design”, discussing risks in running a bridge is to be relased at Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2009), <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes09-bridge-attack" title="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes09-bridge-attack">http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes09-bridge-attack</a>.</li>
<li>Started development of “marco” to quickly scan for Tor relay and brige reachability from a client machine. This utility was used successfully by volunteers inside Iran and China to determine how much of the Tor network is blocked and how such blocking is occurring.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outreach and Advocacy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Roger, Paul Syverson, and Andrew gave a Tor lecture to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Operational Technology Division as part of their quarterly series of talks on new technology. Had a follow-on conversation with a Supervisory Special Agent about how to use Tor tools safely in the field.</li>
<li>Roger and Andrew had a meeting with the US Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to present what Tor is and how it works. We also discussed issues and challenges in their usage of, and prosecuting criminals using, Tor.</li>
<li>Roger and Andrew met with a Senior Policy Advisor from Senator Harry Reid’s office to discuss online privacy and anonymity.</li>
<li>Roger is working with a freshman class at KAIST in South Korea to develop Tor bridge relay distribution strategies. More information can be found at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On September 11, we released Tor Browser Bundle version 1.2.9. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-129-released</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Deployed a temporary workaround for a vidalia/tor bug where bridges don’t work if you provide a fingerprint and the bridge authority is unreachable. Discovered this bug on September 25 when China blocked the bridge authority.</li>
<li>Started fixing bridge statistics that have been broken in all 0.2.2.x versions. Plan to test the fixes in the next few days and include the changes in 0.2.2.5-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A research paper on scaling our directory design, “Scalable onion routing with Torsk” is to be presented at CCS 2009, <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib#ccs09-torsk" title="http://freehaven.net/anonbib#ccs09-torsk">http://freehaven.net/anonbib#ccs09-torsk</a>.</li>
<li>Deployed Mike Perry’s Bandwidth Authority code to the Directory Authorities. The bandwidth authorities are now voting on measured bandwidth from relays and giving out this information in extra-info fields to Tor clients. Tor 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 clients make routing decisions based on these extra-info data. This should spread traffic across relays and improve overall performance of the Tor network.</li>
<li>Included the results of Mike’s bandwidth scanner in the votes of gabelmoo. Helped evaluating the (impressive) performance improvements as seen by torperf, <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/torperf-2009-09-22.pdf" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/torperf-2009-09-22.pdf">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/performance/to...</a>. Initial results imply a 30-50% increase in performance.</li>
<li>Evaluated how the reduction of circuit windows from 1000 to 101 cells affects performance. The last report includes 40 KiB, 50 KiB, and 1 MiB downloads, <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/circwindow-2009-09-20.pdf" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/circwindow-2009-09-20.pdf">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/circwindow/cir...</a>.</li>
<li>Evaluated how Mike’s buildtimes patch influences Tor performance, <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buildtimes/buildtimes-2009-09-22.pdf" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buildtimes/buildtimes-2009-09-22.pdf">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/buildtimes/bui...</a>.</li>
<li>Wrote a script that parses descriptor archives to tell whether an IP address was a Tor relay at a given time, <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/archives/trunk/exonerator/HOWTO" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/archives/trunk/exonerator/HOWTO">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/archives/trunk/exonerator/HOWTO</a>.</li>
<li>Restarted the autonaming script on September 20, so that gabelmoo will be naming relays again soon.</li>
<li>Fixed the remaining bugs in the proposal 166 implementation. Relays can now include their statistics in extra-info descriptors. Further testing this on select relays for a few more days. Soon will ask people on or-dev to turn on statistics as soon as tests are successful and 0.2.2.4-alpha is out.</li>
