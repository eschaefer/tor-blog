          <p><p>Welcome to the second issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the great Tor community.</p>

<h1>First release candidate for Tor 0.2.4.x series</h1>

<p>On July 3rd, Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028776.html">announced the release of Tor 0.2.4.15-rc</a>. As “rc” suggests, it is the first release candidate for the 0.2.4.x series. This version fixes a few smaller bugs over the latest alpha, but “generally appears stable,” Roger noted.</p>

<p>Some highlights of <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/b13c6becc:/ChangeLog">changes from 0.2.3.x</a>:</p>

<h2>- bridges now report the pluggable transports they support to the bridge authority ( <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/3589">#3589</a>),</h2>

<ul>
<li>IPv6 support ( <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/5534">#5534</a>, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/5535">#5535</a>, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/6362">#6362</a>, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/6363">#6363</a>),</li>
<li>automatically forward the TCP ports of pluggable transport proxies using tor-fw-helper if PortForwarding is enabled ( <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/6522">#6522</a>),</li>
<li>switch to a nonrecursive Makefile structure. Where available, now use automake’s “silent” make rules by default ( <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/4567">#4567</a>),</li>
<li>many, many more small improvements and fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">download it and test widely and wildly</a>.</p>

<h1>New vulnerability in Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-10?</h1>

<p>An <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9195">anonymous reporter reported</a> a potential leak when using the Tor Browser Bundle on Windows. If Microsoft Security Essentials or another cloud based anti-virus solution is configured, downloads will automatically be sent to these external providers — bypassing Tor — once complete.</p>

<p>The reporter suggested setting the <code>browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone</code> property to <code>false</code> to prevent anti-virus solutions from starting without user interaction.</p>

<h1>The Tor Project is hiring a Lead Automation Engineer</h1>

<p>Do you have experience programming in multiple languages, including Java, Python/Ruby, shell scripting, and JavaScript?</p>

<p>The Tor Project <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005119.html">opened a new position</a> as Lead Automation Engineer. The project seeks to deploy nightly builds and continuous integration for as many of its key software components and platform combinations as possible. Mike Perry wrote, “Candidates are expected to be capable of taking the lead in selecting, deploying, and maintaining multiple automation systems in several different programming languages.”</p>

<p>For more details, including information on how to apply, see <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-lead-automation.html.en">the job posting</a>.</p>

<h1>check.torproject.org outage</h1>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-check-outage-03-and-04-july-2013">As Andrew Lewman wrote on Thursday, July 4th</a>, “over the past 24 hours <code>https://check.torproject.org</code> has been unavailable due to excessive DNS queries to the exitlist service. It seems there are a number of individuals and companies with commercial products relying upon this volunteer service. We finally hit the point where we couldn’t keep up with the queries and simply disabled the service”.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the service is again available, but the project might “take it down as needed without notice.”</p>

<p>‘check.torproject.org’ is no longer the homepage for Tails since <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.16/">January of this year</a>. The Tor Browser Bundle will also <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7494">switch to a new homepage in version 3</a>, currently in alpha stage.</p>

<p>Other software or services that depend on check.torproject.org should either migrate away or run their own version using <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/Tor/check/trunk/">the source code for the web page</a>. It is supported by a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorDNSExitList">database of running exit nodes that can be queried through DNS</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to help, one need is to make it easier for third parties to get their own “check” service running. This means <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9204">getting the service more modular</a> and improving <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tordnsel.git">TorDNSEL</a> or finishing <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbel.git">TorBEL</a>. Someone must also write documentation that is easy to follow.</p>

<h1>An experimental transparent Tor proxy for Windows</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028809.html">basil announced a new experimental transparent Tor proxy for using Tor on Windows</a>: “1) It (transparently) reroutes all HTTP traffic through the Tor anonymity network; and 2) It blocks all non-Tor traffic (including DNS) to and from your computer.”</p>

<p>The project is currently dubbed TorWall but the name is likely to change as it is problematic regarding the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq">Tor trademark</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028833.html">Roger pointed out</a> that there is already a discontinued project called Torwall. Roger also pointed out that transparent proxying might not be the best solutions “on the theory that if the given application isn’t specifically configured to use Tor, it’s probably going to screw up privacy-wise.”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028840.html">basil answered</a> by stating that the project was “really for those who know and understand the risks (possibly a very limited market?).” Feel free to give it a try if you do!</p>

<h1>Theft of Tor relay private keys?</h1>

<p>On Tuesday, July 2nd, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028749.html">Thomas H. expressed concern</a> about a hypothetical attacker breaking into a large number of nodes and stealing their private keys, combined with gathering all the traffic possible. “Wouldn’t this increase the likelihood that data from complete circuits can be decrypted and traced back to the original sender?”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028751.html">response to this question</a>, Mike Perry admits that he shares Thomas’ concerns: “If their intercepts are passive, merely stealing relays’ private identity key won’t accomplish much because Tor uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy">Forward Secrecy</a> for both the relay TLS links and for circuit setup. However, if their intercepts are active (as in they can arbitrarily manipulate traffic in-flight), then stealing either Guard node keys or directory authority keys allows complete route capture and traffic discovery of targeted clients”.</p>

<p>To avoid this danger, Mike Perry has previously suggested “changes to Tor to make such key theft easier to detect, less damaging, and harder to make use of” (see <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7126">#7126</a>, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/5968">#5968</a>).</p>

<p>Mike also supports the idea of <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/5563">regular identity key rotation for relays</a>. He would like to see support for default key rotation in the future.</p>

<p>Mike pointed out that currently changing an identity key too frequently has several disadvantages for the Tor network: “First, it takes the bandwidth measurement servers a couple days to ramp up your capacity of your new identity key, so you will spend a lot of time below your max throughput. Second, you would also likely never get the Guard flag. Third, there are also load balancing issues with Guard nodes where as soon as you get the Guard flag, it will take 1-2 months before clients switch to your new Guard, so you will also likely spend that time at less than your full capacity.”</p>

<p>If you are operating a relay, please check the wiki page with <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorRelaySecurity">tips for enhancing the relay’s security</a>.</p>

<h1>A new interface to explore the Tor network</h1>

<p>On June 25th, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005063.html">Christian (makepanic) announced</a> a new web application to explore the Tor network. Based on the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js framework</a>, it uses data from <a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo</a> to display information about Tor relays and bridges.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005122.html">Karsten pointed out</a>, this tool already has the same set of features as <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a> — the current recommended way to get details about relays — and even a few more: it can “list 10 fastest relays on start page” and “show bridge details”. As Onionoo was designed exactly to offer a backend for various visualization tools, Karsten thinks “it’s fine to have more than one website providing access to Onionoo data. Yay, diversity.”</p>

<p>Feel free to play with <a href="http://makepanic.github.io/emberjs-tor-onionoo/">Tor Onionoo search</a> or have a look at <a href="https://github.com/makepanic/emberjs-tor-onionoo">its source code</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>Karsten Loesing has <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/2a61b0dd6be">updated GeoIP databases for Tor and Onionoo to July MaxMind databases</a> without their A1 Anonymous Proxy ranges. See <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/6266">#6266</a> for more details on why and how we need to fix the data released by MaxMind.</p>

<p>It looks like the ‘start-tor-browser’ shell script cannot be used to start the Tor Browser from the graphical file manager on Ubuntu 13.04. If you have any great ideas, <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9091">please chime in</a>.</p>

<p>If you can write C code, you could make the lives of many relay operators easier by making tor configuration accept “bit/s” on top of the current “byte/s” [43]. The former, being more commonly used by network operators to describe bandwidth, could reduce a common case of confusion. It looks like <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9214">a patch would be pretty simple</a>!</p>

<p>Work has started on a pluggable transport that would <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7167">combine the traffic obfuscation properties of obfsproxy with the address diversity of Flashproxy</a>.</p>

<p>intrigeri has <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003240.html">announced two “low-hanging fruits” sessions for Tails</a>. Feel free to join the #tails IRC channel on July 11th at 8:00 UTC or on July 13, 2013, at 7:00 UTC. “Everyone interested in contributing to Tails is warmly welcome to join! The idea is to spend a while together on many small tasks that take less than 2 hours each, and are waiting in our TODO list for too long.” He also gave a list of candidate tasks.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2013-July/000157.html">Erinn Clark pointed out</a>, the 3.x branch of Tor Browser is currently missing a map of relays similar to the one shown in Vidalia. The latter can be kept as a separate application, but this specific bit of functionality might simply be implementable using web technologies. Care to give it a try?</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for June 2013</h1>

<p>Continuing from last week, more monthly reports are now available for June 2013: <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000280.html">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000284.html">Aaron G.</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000285.html">Runa A. Sandvik</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000286.html">Mike Perry</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000287.html">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000288.html">Tails folks</a>, and the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000289.html">Tor help desk</a>.</p>

          <p><p>Welcome to the very first issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the vibrant Tor community.</p>

<h1>Deterministic, independently reproduced builds of Tor Browser Bundle</h1>

<p>Mike Perry, Linus Nordberg and Georg Koppen each independently built identical binaries of the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released">Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 alpha 2 release</a>, now <a href="https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/3.0a2/">available for download at the Tor Package Archive</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build">build system</a>, first adopted for the release of 3.0 alpha 1, uses <a href="http://gitian.org/">Gitian</a> to enable anyone to produce byte-identical Tor Browser Bundle binary packages from source. This represents a major improvement in the security of the Tor software build and distribution processes against targeted attacks. The motivations and technical details of this work will appear in future Tor Project blog posts.</p>

<h1>Minor progress on datagram-based transport</h1>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/moving-tor-datagram-transport">As Steven Murdoch explained in 2011</a>, in the current implementation of Tor, “when a packet gets dropped or corrupted on a link between two Tor nodes, […], all circuits passing through this pair of nodes will be stalled, not only the circuit corresponding to the packet which was dropped.” This is because traffic from multiple circuits heading into an OR node are multiplexed by default into a single TCP connection. However, when the reliability and congestion control requirements of TCP streams are enforced (by the operating system) on this multiplexed connection, a situation is created in which one poor quality circuit can disproportionately slow down the others.</p>

<p>This shortcoming could be worked around by migrating Tor from TCP to a datagram-based transport protocol. Nick Mathewson opened <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9165">#9165</a> to track progress on the matter.</p>

<p>Late last year, Steven Murdoch began an <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/sjm217/tor.git/shortlog/refs/heads/utp">experimental Tor branch using uTP</a>, a protocol “which provides reliable, ordered delivery while maintaining minimum extra delay”, and is already <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html">used by uTorrent for peer-to-peer connections</a>. Nick Mathewson finally got to review his work and wrote several comments on <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9166">#9166</a>. The code isn’t close to production-quality right now; it is just good enough for performance testing.</p>

<h1>obfsproxyssh</h1>

<p>Yawning Angel sent out <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005083.html">a request for comments</a> on the very first release of <a href="https://github.com/Yawning/obfsproxyssh">obfsproxyssh</a>, a pluggable transport that uses the ssh wire protocol to hide Tor traffic. Its behavior would appear to potential eavesdroppers to be “identical to a user sshing to a host, authenticating with a RSA public/private key pair and opening a direct-tcp channel to the ORPort of the bridge.”</p>

<p>The announcement contains several open issues and questions. Feel free to have a look and voice your comments!</p>

<h1>Crowdfunding for Tor exit relays and bridges</h1>

<p>Moritz Bartl announced that he has started a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tor-anti-censorship-and-anonymity-infrastructure/">crowdfunding campaign for Tor exit relays and bridges</a>.</p>

<p>The donations will be distributed equally among all Torservers.net partner organizations (Zwiebelfreunde e.V., DFRI, Nos Oignons, Swiss Privacy Foundation, Frënn vun der Ënn and NoiseTor).</p>

<h1>Tails 0.19 is out, new stable Tor Browser Bundles</h1>

<p>On Wednesday, June 26, two of the most popular Tor projects both made new releases: the Tor Browser Bundle, and Tails, The Amnesiac Incognito Live System. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages">stable Tor Browser Bundle was updated to version 2.3.25-10</a>, and includes fixes from upstream Firefox 17.0.7esr. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.19/">Tails 0.19</a> includes the new stable Tor Browser, along with an updated 3.9.5 kernel and minor security improvements to wireless, GNOME and GnuPG defaults.</p>

<h1>Jenkins + Stem catching their first regression</h1>

<p>Quoting <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-June/000262.html">Damian Johnson’s June status report</a>: “Our automated
Jenkins test runs caught their first instance of tor regression. This
concerned LOADCONF’s behavior after merging a branch for ticket #6752”.
A <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9122">new ticket</a> was opened after Damian properly identified the issue.</p>

<h1>First round of reports from GSoC projects</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005078.html">Johannes Fürmann reported</a> on his project, a virtual network environment intended to simulate censorship for OONI (dubbed “Evil Genius”, after Descartes). <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005082.html">Hareesan reported</a> on the steganography browser addon. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005085.html">Cristian-Matei Toader is working</a> on adding capabilities-based sandboxing to Tor on Linux, using the kernel’s seccomp syscall filtering mechanism. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005086.html">Chang Lan implemented</a> a HTTP proxy-based transport using CONNECT as the first step in his efforts to implement a general Tor-over-HTTP pluggable transport.</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for June 2013</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of June has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-June/000262.html">Damian Johnson</a>’s was the first, followed soon after by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-June/000263.html">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000264.html">Colin C.</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000266.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000267.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000268.html">Moritz Bartl</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000269.html">Jason Tsai</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000270.html">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000271.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000272.html">Kelley Misata</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000273.html">Matt Pagan</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000276.html">Andrea Shepard</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor on StackExchange</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor-online-anonymity-privacy-and-security">proposed StackExchange Q&amp;A page for Tor</a> has left the “initial definition” stage and has entered the “commitment” stage on Area 51. During <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-June/028473.html">this stage</a>, interested users are asked to digitally “sign” the proposal with their name to help ensure the site will have an active community during its critical early days.</p>

<h1>Forensic analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle</h1>

<p>On Friday, June 28, Runa Sandvik published Tor Tech Report 2013-06-001, titled <a href="https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf">Forensic Analysis of the Tor Browser Bundle on OS X, Linux, and Windows</a>, as part of a deliverable project for two Tor sponsors. The report is a detailed write-up of the forensic experiments Sandvik has been <a href="http://encrypted.cc/post/51552592311/forensic-analysis-of-tor-on-os-x">documenting on her blog</a>, the goal of which was “to identify traces left behind by the Tor Browser Bundle after extracting, using, and deleting the bundle”.</p>

<p>In short, each platform indeed retains forensic traces of the existence of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many “are related to default operating system settings, some of which the bundle might not be able to remove. We therefore <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7033">propose the creation of a document</a> which lists steps our users can take to mitigate these traces on the different operating systems.”</p>

<p>Of course, Tor Browser Bundle users wishing to take immediate action to prevent the creation of forensic traces are not out of luck: “the easiest way to avoid leaving traces on a computer system is to use <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">The Amnesiac Incognito Live System (Tails)</a>.”</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>David Goulet is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005069.html">making good progress</a> on his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/004959.html">rewrite of torsocks</a> and should have a beta ready in a couple of weeks. He awaits your code reviews, comments and contributions.</p>

<p>Leo Unglaub ran into some trouble with a dependency just as he was about to publish the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005084.html">work-in-progress code for his Vidalia replacement</a>.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson did some analysis on <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/7009">possible methods for reducing the volume of fetched directory information</a>, by running some scripts over the last month of consensus directories.</p>

<h1>A vulnerability affecting microdescriptors in Tor?</h1>

<p>On Friday, June 28 an anonymous individual <a href="https://twitter.com/ewrwerwtretetet/status/350815079882686464">contacted Tor developers</a> over Twitter <a href="http://pastebin.com/pRiMx0CW">claiming to have found a vulnerability</a> in the way microdescriptors are validated by Tor clients which would allow “determination of the source and end-point of a given [victim’s] tor connection with little more than a couple relays and some rogue directory authorities [both controlled by the adversary].”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-June/028699.html">Detailed</a> <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-June/028700.html">testing</a> by Nick Mathewson could not reproduce the behavior in the Tor client that was claimed to enable such an attack. After a lengthy Twitter debate with Mathewson, the reporter disappeared, no bugs have been filed, and it appears the vulnerability was nothing of the sort. Without being able to verify the existence of the claimed vulnerability, Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-June/028701.html">concluded</a> that the reporter’s described attack was equivalent “at worst… to the ‘request filtering’ attack… which has defenses”.</p>

<p>The issue was also <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jun/245">mentioned</a> (and likewise dismissed) on the security mailing list, Full Disclosure.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in reporting vulnerabilities in Tor software, please avoid following that example. Until a process gets <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9186">documented</a>, the best way to report the discovery of a vulnerability is to get in touch with one of the Tor core developers using encrypted email.</p>
