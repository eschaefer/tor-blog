          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Looking for a way to help the Internet stay open and free? This topic needs some dedicated people to give it more attention — it could easily grow to as large a project as Tor itself. In the short term, OTF&#39;s <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a> has expressed interest in funding somebody to get this project going, and EFF&#39;s Eva Galperin has said she&#39;d be happy to manage the person as an OTF fellow at EFF, with mentorship from Tor people. The first round of those proposals has a deadline in a few days, but if that timeframe doesn&#39;t work for you, this problem isn&#39;t going away: let us know and we can work with you to help you coordinate other funding.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>We used to think there are two main ways that the Tor network can fail. First, legal or policy pressure can make it so nobody is willing to run a relay. Second, pressure on or from Internet Service Providers can reduce the number of places willing to host exit relays, which in turn squeezes down the anonymity that the network can provide. Both of these threats are hard to solve, but they are challenges that we&#39;ve known about for a decade, and due in large part to strong ongoing collaborations we have a pretty good handle on them.</p>

<p>We missed a third threat to Tor&#39;s success: a growing number of websites treat users from anonymity services differently. Slashdot doesn&#39;t let you post comments over Tor, Wikipedia won&#39;t let you edit over Tor, and Google sometimes gives you a captcha when you try to search (depending on what other activity they&#39;ve seen from that exit relay lately). Some sites like Yelp go further and refuse to even serve pages to Tor users.</p>

<p>The result is that the Internet as we know it is siloing. Each website operator works by itself to figure out how to handle anonymous users, and generally neither side is happy with the solution. The problem isn&#39;t limited to just Tor users, since these websites face basically the same issue with users from open proxies, users from AOL, users from Africa, etc.</p>

<p>Two recent trends make the problem more urgent. First, sites like Cloudflare, Akamai, and Disqus create bottlenecks where their components are used by many websites. This centralization impacts many websites at once when e.g. Cloudflare changes its strategy for how to handle Tor users. Second, services increasingly outsource their blacklisting, such that e.g. Skype refuses connections from IP addresses that run Tor exit relays, not because they worry about abuse via Tor (it&#39;s hard to use Skype over Tor), but because their blacklist provider has an incentive to be overbroad in its blocking. (Blacklist providers compete in part by having &quot;the most complete&quot; list, and in many cases it&#39;s hard for services to notice that they&#39;re losing contributions from now-missing users.)</p>

<p>Technical mechanisms do exist to let anonymous users interact with websites in ways that control abuse better. Simple technical approaches include &quot;you can read but you can&#39;t post&quot; or &quot;you have to log in to post&quot;. More complex approaches track reputation of users and give them access to site features based on past behavior of the user rather than on past behavior of their network address. Several research designs suggest using <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing">anonymous credentials</a>, where users anonymously receive a cryptographic credential and then prove to the website that they possess a credential that hasn&#39;t been blacklisted — without revealing their credential, so the website can&#39;t link them to their past behavior.</p>

<p>Social mechanisms have also proven effective in some cases, ranging from community moderation (I hear Wikipedia Germany manually approves edits from users who don&#39;t have sufficiently reputable accounts), to flagging behavior from Tor users (even though you don&#39;t know *which* Tor user it is) so other participants can choose how to interact with them.</p>

<p>But applying these approaches to real-world websites has not gone well overall. Part of the challenge is that the success stories are not well-publicized, so each website feels like it&#39;s dealing with the question in isolation. Some sites do in fact face quite different problems, which require different solutions: Wikipedia doesn&#39;t want jerks to change the content of pages, whereas Yelp doesn&#39;t want competitors to scrape all its pages. We can also imagine that some companies, like ones that get their revenue from targeted advertising, are fundamentally uninterested in allowing anonymous users at all.</p>

<h2>A way forward</h2>

<p>The solution I envision is to get a person who is both technical and good at activism to focus on this topic. Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections, and look for patterns that help us identify the common (centralized) services that impact many sites. At the same time, we should make a list of solutions — technical and social — that are in use today. There are a few community-led starts on the Tor wiki already, like <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/projects/DontBlockMe">the DontBlockMe page</a> and a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor">List of Services Blocking Tor</a>.</p>

<p>Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help. Armed with the toolkit of options we found in step one, we should go to the first (most promising) site on the list and work with them to understand their problem. Ideally we can adapt one of the ideas from the toolkit; otherwise we&#39;ll need to invent and develop a new approach tailored to their situation and needs. Then we should go to the second site on the list with our (now bigger) toolkit, and so on down the list. Once we have some success stories, we can consider how to scale better, such as holding a conference where we invite the five best success cases plus the next five unsolved sites on our list.</p>

<p>A lot of the work will be building and maintaining social connections with engineers at the services, to help them understand what&#39;s possible and to track regressions (for example, every year or so Google gets a new engineer in charge of deciding when to give out Captchas, and they seem to have no institutional memory of how the previous one decided to handle Tor users). It might be that the centralization of Cloudflare et al can be turned around into an advantage, where making sure they have a good practices will scale to help many websites at once.</p>

<p>EFF is the perfect organization to lead this charge, given its community connections, its campaigns like <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014">Who has your back?</a>, and its more (at least more than Tor ;) neutral perspective on the topic. And now, when everybody is sympathetic about the topic of surveillance, is a great time to try to take back some ground. We have a wide variety of people who want to help, from scientists and research groups who would help with technical solutions if only they understood the real problems these sites face, to users and activists who can help publicize both the successful cases and the not-yet-successful cases.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to the future, I&#39;m also part of an upcoming research collaboration with Dan Boneh, Andrea Forte, Rachel Greenstadt, Ryan Henry, Benjamin Mako Hill, and Dan Wallach who will look both at the technical side of the problem (building more useful ideas for the toolkit) and also the social side of the problem: how can we quantify the loss to Wikipedia, and to society at large, from turning away anonymous contributors? Wikipedians say &quot;we have to blacklist all these IP addresses because of trolls&quot; and &quot;Wikipedia is rotting because nobody wants to edit it anymore&quot; in the same breath, and we believe these points are related. The group is at the &quot;applying for an NSF grant&quot; stage currently, so it will be a year or more before funding appears, but I mention it because we should get somebody to get the ball rolling now, and hopefully we can expect reinforcements to appear as momentum builds.</p>

<p>In summary, if this call to arms catches your eye, your next steps are to think about what you most want to work on to get started, and how you would go about doing it. You can apply for an OTF fellowship, or we can probably help you find other funding sources as needed too.</p>

	      <p>Welcome to the thirty-fourth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Orfox: a new Firefox-based secure browser for Android</h1>

<p>With the growing popularity of pocket computers (also known as “phones”), users need to have access to censorship-circumvention and anonymity systems on these devices as well as on their desktop or laptop machines. While there is currently no supported implementation of Tor for Apple’s iOS, the <a href="https://guardianproject.info">Guardian Project</a> works closely with the Tor Project to produce (amongst other software) a Tor client for Android named <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">Orbot</a>. Mobile applications can be proxied through Orbot just as they can through the Tor client on other operating systems, but mobile web browsing potentially suffers from the same issues that the Tor Browser was designed to protect against, such as disk leaks and a large attack surface. The Guardian Project has therefore also been maintaining a dedicated mobile browser for use with Orbot under the name <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb/">Orweb</a>.</p>

<p>Orweb is based on WebView, and is limited by that browser’s features; flaws such as the <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/30/recent-news-on-orweb-flaws/">potential HTML5 IP leak</a>, while possible to work around in the short term, have made it clear that the best future for secure mobile browsing lies in a switch to an application based on Firefox/Fennec/GeckoView.</p>

<p>Following a successful Google Summer of Code project by <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007379.html">Amogh Pradeep</a> and work by other Guardian Project members, Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-August/003717.html">announced</a> that “a real working version” of Orfox, the new Orbot-compatible mobile browser, is now available. “All the necessary defaults [have been] changed to match Tor Browser’s defaults as closely as possible”; the developers also “remove the Android permissions for things like camera, mic, GPS” and “turn off webrtc.”</p>

<p>“We still need to figure out which preferences and features map between the desktop mobile browser and the Android version, so there is quite a bit of work to do”, but you can download and test this initial version by following the links in Nathan’s email. “Over the next few months we hope to launch this as our new official browser for Orbot, and deprecate Orweb as quickly as possible”, he concluded.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>A new release of ooniprobe, the network interference data collector for <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI</a>, was <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-August/000147.html">announced</a> by Arturo Filastò. Version 1.1.0 introduces a new command line tool “for listing the reports that have not been published to a collector and that allows the probe operator to choose which ones they would like to upload”. The new version also improves the privacy of the reports by sanitizing file paths.</p>

<p>Developers of applications using <a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo</a> — the web service to learn about currently running Tor relays and bridges — are invited to join the new <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/onionoo-announce">onionoo-announce mailing list</a>. Keeping the list low volume, Karsten Loesing plans on using it to announce major protocol changes, scheduled maintenance, major bug fixes, and other important news.</p>

<p>Yawning Angel has <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007404.html">made available</a> an experimental version of the Tor Browser that includes the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4">obfs4</a> pluggable transport. Testing on Windows and OS X would be particularly welcome.</p>

<p>Fabian Keil <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007412.html">reported</a> that FreeBSD now includes ports of liballium and obfsclient.</p>

<p>JusticeRage <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005168.html">explained</a> how relay operators who offer exiting on port 25 can protect the reputation of their domain name by using the Sender Policy Framework.</p>

<p>Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi sent the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007399.html">final GSoC report</a> for the Tor Weather rewrite project. Juha Nurmi sent <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000625.html">another report</a> on the development of ahmia.fi.</p>

<p>Thanks to s7r for hosting a new <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000669.html">mirror</a> of the Tor Project’s website and software!</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users of different VPN (Virtual Private Network) services have told the help desk that Tor Browser has difficulty connecting to Tor when a VPN is in use. Using Tor with a VPN is not supported. For a trusted entry into the Tor network, bridges and pluggable transports are recommended, while for anonymizing all network traffic coming from a computer, <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> is recommended.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>The bandwidth authority scanners measure the actual bandwidth offered by Tor relays in order to get accurate information into the Tor consensus. The measurement process currently splits up the set of relays that are to be measured into 4 subsets, with the goal that measuring each of these subsets should take <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/3440">about the same time</a>. However, this is not the case. Measuring subsets 2 and 3 is about twice as fast as measuring subset 1, and subset 4 is twice as fast as subset 2 and 3. If you&#39;re up for doing some experiments to split up the set into more equal subsets, please let us know about your findings on the ticket.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.4 and 4.0-alpha-1 are out</h1>

<p>Erinn Clark took to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-364-and-40-alpha-1-are-released">Tor Blog</a> to announce two new releases by the Tor Browser team. The stable version (3.6.4) contains fixes for several new OpenSSL bugs, although since Tor should only be vulnerable to one of them, and “as this issue is only a DoS”, it is not considered a critical security update. This release also brings Tor Browser users the fixes that give log warnings about the RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack explained <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">last month</a>. Please be sure to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Alongside this stable release, the first alpha version of Tor Browser 4.0 is now available. Among the most exciting new features of this series is the inclusion of the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> pluggable transport. In contrast to the bridge-based transports already available in Tor Browser, meek relies on a principle of “too big to block”, as its creator David Fifield <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport#comment-70044">explained</a>: “instead of going through a bridge with a secret address, you go through a known domain (<a href="http://www.google.com" title="www.google.com">www.google.com</a> for example) that the censor will be reluctant to block. You don’t need to look up any bridge addresses before you get started”. meek currently supports two “front domains”, Google and Amazon Web Services; it may therefore be especially useful for users behind extremely restrictive national or local firewalls. David posted a fuller explanation of meek, and how to configure it, in a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport">separate blog post</a>.</p>

<p>This alpha release also “paves the way to [the] upcoming autoupdater by reorganizing the directory structure of the browser”, as Erinn wrote. This means that users upgrading from any previous Tor Browser series cannot extract the new version over their existing Tor Browser folder, or it will not work.</p>

<p>You can consult the full list of changes and bugfixes for both versions in Erinn’s post, and download the new releases themselves from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">Tor website</a>.</p>

<h1>The Tor network no longer supports designating relays by name</h1>

<p>Since the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/161d7d1:/src/config/torrc.in#l20">very first versions of Tor</a>, relay operators have been able to specify “nicknames” for their relays. Such nicknames were initially meant to be unique across the network, and operators of directory authorities would manually “bind” a relay identity key after verifying the nickname. The process became formalized with the “Named” flag introduced in the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/attic/dir-spec-v2.txt#l427">0.1.1 series</a>, and later automated with the 0.2.0 series. If a relay held a unique nickname for long enough, the authoritywould recognize the binding, and subsequently reserve the name for half a year.</p>

<p>Nicknames are useful because it appears humans are not very good at thinking using long strings of random bits. Initially, they made it possible to understand what was happening in the network more easily, and to designate a specific relay in an abbreviated way. Having two relays in the network with the same nickname is not really problematic when one is looking at nodes, or a list in <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/search/query=Unnamed">Globe</a>, as relays can always be differentiated by their IP addresses or identity keys.</p>

<p>But complications arise when nicknames are used to specify one relay to the exclusion of another. If the wrong relay gets selected, it can become a security risk. Even though <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/122-unnamed-flag.txt">real efforts</a> have been made to improve the situation, properly enforcing uniqueness has always been problematic, and a burden for the few directory authorities that handle naming.</p>

<p>Back in April, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">“Heartbleed” bug</a> forced many relays to switch to a new identity key, thus losing their “Named” flag. Because this meant that anyone designating relays by their nickname would now have a hard time continuing to do so, Sebastian Hahn decided to use the opportunity to <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/235-kill-named-flag.txt">get rid of the idea entirely</a>.</p>

<p>This week, Sebastian <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007348.html">wrote</a>: “Code review down to 0.2.3.x has shown that the naming-related code hasn’t changed much at all, and no issues were found which would mean a Named-flag free consensus would cause any problems. gabelmoo and tor26 have stopped acting as Naming Directory Authorities, and — pending any issues — will stay that way.”</p>

<p>This means that although you can still give your relay a nickname in its configuration file, designating relays by nickname for any other purpose (such as telling Tor to avoid using certain nodes) has now stopped working. “If you — in your Tor configuration file — refer to any relay by name and not by identity hash, please change that immediately. Future versions of Tor will not support using names in the configuration at all”, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-August/034380.html">warns Sebastian</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>meejah <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007375.html">announced</a> the release of version 0.11.0 of txtorcon, a Twisted-based Python controller library for Tor. This release brings several API improvements; see meejah’s message for full release notes and instructions on how to download it.</p>

<p>Mike Perry posted an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isec-partners-conducts-tor-browser-hardening-study">overview</a> of a recent report put together by iSEC Partners and commissioned by the Open Technology Fund to explore “current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser”. Among other things, Mike’s post addresses the report’s immediate hardening recommendations, latest thoughts on the proposed Tor Browser “security slider”, and longer-term security development measures, as well as ways in which the development of Google Chrome could inform Tor Browser’s own security engineering.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson asked for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007355.html">comments</a> on Trunnel, “a little tool to automatically generate binary encoding and parsing code based on C-like structure descriptions” intended to prevent “Heartbleed”-style vulnerabilities from creeping into Tor’s binary-parsing code in C. “My open questions are: Is this a good idea? Is it a good idea to use this in Tor? Are there any tricky bugs left in the generated code? What am I forgetting to think of?”, wrote Nick.</p>

<p>George Kadianakis followed up his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007042.html">journey to the core</a> of what Tor does when trying to connect to entry guards in the absence of a network connection with <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007346.html">another post</a> running through some possible improvements to Tor’s behavior in these situations: “I’m looking forward to some feedback on the proposed algorithms as well as improvements and suggestions”.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007353.html">requested feedback</a> on some proposed changes to the format of the “test deck” used by ooni-probe, the main project of the Open Observatory of Network Interference. “A test deck is basically a way of telling it ‘Run this list of OONI tests with these inputs and by the way be sure you also set these options properly when doing so’…This new format is supposed to overcome some of the limitations of the old design and we hope that a major redesign will not be needed in the near future”, wrote Arturo.</p>

<p>Tor’s importance to users who are at risk, for a variety of reasons, makes it an attractive target for creators of malware, who distribute fake or modified versions of Tor software for malicious purposes. Following a recent report of a fake Tor Browser in circulation, Julien Voisin carried out an investigation of the compromised software, and posted a <a href="http://dustri.org/b/torbundlebrowserorg.html">detailed analysis</a> of the results. To ensure you are protected against this sort of attack, make sure you <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures">verify</a> any Tor software you download before running it!</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>In May, the <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/">Open Technology Fund</a> commissioned <a href="https://www.isecpartners.com/">iSEC Partners</a> to study current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser. The Open Technology Fund is the primary funder of Tor Browser development, and it commissions security analysis and review for all of the projects that it funds as a standard practice. We worked with iSEC to define the scope of the engagement to focus on the following six main areas:</p>

<ol>
<li> Review of the current state of hardening in Tor Browser</li>
<li> Investigate additional hardening options and instrumentation</li>
<li> Perform historical vulnerability analysis on Firefox, in order to make informed vulnerability surface reduction recommendations</li>
<li> Investigate image, audio, and video codecs and their respective library&#39;s vulnerability history</li>
<li> Review our current about:config settings, both for vulnerability surface reduction and security</li>
<li> Review alternate/obscure protocol and application handlers</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/tree/master/reports/Tor%20Browser%20Bundle">complete report</a> is available in the iSEC publications github repo. All tickets related to the report can be found using the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=%7Etbb-isec-report">tbb-isec-report keyword</a>. General Tor Browser security tickets can be found using the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=%7Etbb-security">tbb-security keyword</a>.</p>

<h1>Major Findings and Recommendations</h1>

<p>The report had the following high-level findings and recommendations.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Address Space Layout Randomization is disabled on Windows and Mac</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Participate in Pwn2Own</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Test and recommend the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit on Windows</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Replace the Firefox memory allocator (jemalloc) with ctmalloc/PartitionAlloc</strong></li>
<li>  <strong>Make use of advanced ParitionAlloc features and other instrumentation to reduce the risk from use-after-free vulnerabilities</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Vulnerability Surface Reduction (Security Slider)</h1>

<p>A large portion of the report was also focused on analyzing historical Firefox vulnerability data and other sources of large vulnerability surface for a planned &quot;Security Slider&quot; UI in Tor Browser.</p>

<p>The Security Slider was first suggested by Roger Dingledine as a way to make it easy for users to trade off between functionality and security, gradually disabling features ranked by both vulnerability count and web prevalence/usability impact.</p>

<p>The report makes several recommendations along these lines, but a brief distillation can be found on the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387#comment:43">ticket for the slider</a>.</p>

<p>At a high level, we plan for four levels in this slider. &quot;Low&quot; security will be the current Tor Browser settings, with the addition of JIT support. &quot;Medium-Low&quot; will disable most of the JIT, and make HTML5 media click-to-play via NoScript. &quot;Medium-High&quot; will disable the rest of the JIT, will disable JS on non-HTTPS url bar origins, and disable SVG. &quot;High&quot; will fully disable Javascript, block remote fonts via NoScript, and disable all media codecs except for WebM (which will remain click-to-play).</p>

<h1>The Long Term</h1>

<p>A web browser is a very large and complicated piece of software, and while we believe that the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">privacy properties</a> of Tor Browser are better than those of every other web browser currently available, it is very important to us that we raise the bar to successful code execution and exploitation of Tor Browser as well.</p>

<p>We are very eager to see the deployment of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">sandboxing support in Firefox</a>, which should go a long way to improving the security of Tor Browser as well. To improve security for their users, Mozilla has recently shifted <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mozilla.dev.platform/e10s/mozilla.dev.platform/q0Ku_8j26Pc/OtHXnNThv0IJ">10 engineers</a> into the Electrolysis project, which provides the groundwork for producing a multiprocess sandbox architecture for the desktop Firefox. This will allow them to provide a Google Chrome style security sandbox for website content, to reduce the risk from software vulnerabilities, and generally impede exploitability.</p>

<p>Until that time, we will also be investigating providing <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10599">hardened builds of Tor Browser</a> using the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/vtv">Virtual Table Verification</a> features of newer GCC releases. While this will not eliminate all vectors of memory corruption-based exploitation (in particular, the hardening properties of AddressSanitizer are not as good as those provided by <a href="www.github.com/santoshn/softboundcets-34/">SoftBounds+CETS</a> for example, but that compiler is not yet production-ready), it should raise the bar to exploitation. We are hopeful that these builds in combination with PartitionAlloc and the Security Slider will satisfy the needs of our users who require high security and who are willing to trade performance and usability in order to get it.</p>

<p>We also hope to include optional <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5791">application-wide sandboxes</a> for Tor Browser as part of the official distribution.</p>

<h1>Why not Google Chrome?</h1>

<p>It is no secret that in many ways, both we and Mozilla are playing catch-up to reach the level of code execution security provided by Google Chrome, and in fact closely following the Google Chrome security team was one of the recommendations of the iSEC report.</p>

<p>In particular, Google Chrome benefits from a <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/guts">multiprocess sandboxing architecture</a>, as well as several further <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet">hardening options and innovations</a> (such as PartitionAlloc).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our budget for the browser project is still very constrained compared to the amount of work that is required to provide the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">privacy properties we feel are important</a>, and Firefox remains a far more cost-effective platform for us for several reasons. In particular, Firefox&#39;s flexible extension system, fully scriptable UI, solid proxy support, and its long Extended Support Release cycle all allow us to accomplish far more with fewer resources than we could with any other web browser.</p>

<p>Further, Google Chrome is far less amenable to supporting <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">basic web privacy</a> and Tor-critical features (such as solid proxy support) than Mozilla Firefox. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fingerprinting">Initial efforts</a> to work with the Google Chrome team saw some success in terms of adding APIs that are crucial to addons such as HTTPS-Everywhere, but we ran into several roadblocks when it came to Tor-specific features and changes. In particular, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ImportantGoogleChromeBugs#ProxyBypassBugs">several bugs required for basic proxy-safe Tor support</a> for Google Chrome&#39;s Incognito Mode ended up blocked for various reasons. The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=80722">worst offender</a> on this front is the use of the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI for certificate validation, without any alternative. This bug means that certificate revocation checking and intermediate certificate retrieval happen outside of the browser&#39;s proxy settings, and is subject to alteration by the OEM and/or the enterprise administrator. Worse, beyond the Tor proxy issues, the use of this OS certificate validation API means that the OEM and enterprise also have a simple entry point for installing their own root certificates to enable transparent HTTPS man-in-the-middle, with full browser validation and no user consent or awareness. All of this is not to mention the need for defenses against <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#identifier-linkability">third party tracking</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability">fingerprinting</a> to prevent the linking of Tor activity to non-Tor usage, and which would also be useful for the wider non-Tor userbase.</p>

<p>While we&#39;d love for this situation to change, and are open to working with Google to improve things, at present it means that our only option for Chrome is to maintain an even more invasive fork than our current Firefox patch set, with much less likelihood of a future merge than with Firefox. As a ballpark estimate, maintaining such a fork would require somewhere between 3 and 5 times the engineering staff and infrastructure we currently have at our disposal, in addition to the ramp-up time to port our current feature set over.</p>

<p>Unless either our funding situation or Google&#39;s attitude towards the features we require changes, Mozilla Firefox will remain the best platform for us to demonstrate that it is in fact possible to provide <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/dnt-ws/position-papers/21.pdf">true privacy by design</a> for the web for those who want it. It is very distressing that this means playing catch-up and forcing our users to make usability tradeoffs in exchange for improved browser security, but we will continue to do what we can to improve that situation, both with Mozilla and with our own independent efforts.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>The recently released 4.0-alpha-1 version of Tor Browser includes <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>, a new <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transport</a> for censorship circumvention. meek tunnels your Tor traffic through HTTPS, and uses a technique called “domain fronting” to hide the fact that you are communicating with a Tor bridge—to the censor it looks like you are talking to some other web site. For more details, see the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Overview">overview</a> and the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports#meek">Child’s Garden of Pluggable Transports</a>.</p>

<p>You only need meek if your Internet connection is censored so that you can’t use ordinary Tor. Even then, you should try other pluggable transports first, because they have less overhead. My recommended order for trying transports is:</p>

<ol>
<li> obfs3</li>
<li> fte</li>
<li> scramblesuit</li>
<li> meek</li>
<li> flashproxy</li>
</ol>

<p>Use meek if other transports don’t work for you, or if you want to help development by testing it. I have been using meek for my day-to-day browsing for a few months now.</p>

<p>All pluggable transports have some overhead. You might find that meek feels slower than ordinary Tor. We’re working on some tickets that will make it faster in the future: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12428" title="Make it possible to have multiple requests and responses in flight">#12428</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12778" title="Put meek HTTP headers on a diet">#12778</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12857" title="Use streaming downloads">#12857</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, there are two different backends supported. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#AmazonCloudFront">meek-amazon</a> makes it look like you are talking to an Amazon Web Services server (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge), and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#GoogleAppEngine">meek-google</a> makes it look like you are talking to the Google search page (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge). It is likely that both will work for you. If one of them doesn’t work, try the other.</p>

<p>These instructions and screenshots are for the 4.0-alpha-1 release. If they change in future releases, they will be updated at <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart</a>.</p>

<h1>How to use meek</h1>

<p>First, download a meek-capable version of Tor Browser for your platform and language.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha" title="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html">Verify the signature</a> and run the bundle according to the instructions for <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#macosx">OS X</a>, or <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#linux">GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

<p>On the first screen, where it says <em>Which of the following best describes your situation?</em>, click the <strong>Configure</strong> button.  </p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Edcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-0.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Which of the following best describes your situation?” screen with the “Configure” button highlighted."></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does this computer need to use a proxy to access the Internet?</em>, say <strong>No</strong> unless you know you need to use a proxy. meek supports using an upstream proxy, but most users don’t need it.  </p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Edcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-1.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does this computer need to use a proxy to access the Internet?” screen with “No” selected."></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does this computer&#39;s Internet connection go through a firewall that only allows connections to certain ports?</em>, say <strong>No</strong>. As an HTTPS transport, meek only uses web ports, which are allowed by most firewalls.  </p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Edcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-2.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does this computer&#39;s Internet connection go through a firewall that only allows connections to certain ports?” screen with “No” selected."></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?</em>, say <strong>Yes</strong>. Saying Yes will lead you to the screen for configuring pluggable transports.  </p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Edcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-3.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?” screen with “Yes” selected."></p>

<p>On the pluggable transport screen, select <strong>Connect with provided bridges</strong> and choose either <strong>meek-amazon</strong> or <strong>meek-google</strong> from the list. Probably both of them will work for you, so choose whichever feels faster. If one of them doesn’t work, try the other. Then click the <strong>Connect</strong> button.  </p>

<p><img src="https://people.torproject.org/%7Edcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-4.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “You may use the provided set of bridges or you may obtain and enter a custom set of bridges.” screen with “meek-google” selected."></p>

<p>If it doesn’t work, you can write to the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev">tor-dev mailing list</a>, or to me personally at <a href="mailto:dcf@torproject.org">dcf@torproject.org</a>, or file a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket?component=meek">new ticket</a>.</p>
