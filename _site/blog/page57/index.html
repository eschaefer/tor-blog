	      <p>The 2nd USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet (FOCI &#39;12) seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners from technology, law, and policy who are working on means to study, detect, or circumvent practices that inhibit free and open communications on the Internet.</p>

<p>The Internet offers great promise for improving the communication capabilities of citizens, but our increasing dependence on networked communications also makes it easier for organizations to control, monitor, and block communications. ISPs and governments routinely restrict access to Internet content and services, either by censoring access to information or by degrading the performance of services or blocking them entirely. Similarly, ISPs can degrade network performance for certain sets of users for some or all services, for arbitrary purposes. ISPs have been found to block or throttle certain application traffic routinely. This growing trend toward blocking, tampering, or otherwise restricting communications on the Internet calls for improved techniques both for monitoring the state of restrictions on Internet content and communications, in order to inform users, and for circumventing attempts to censor, degrade, or otherwise tamper with Internet communications.</p>

<p>The broadening scope of attacks on Internet freedom is forcing more disciplines to address the issue. Last year&#39;s workshop brought together four research communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those studying network neutrality and performance degradation</li>
<li>Those measuring content censorship and blocking of resources and services</li>
<li>Those designing and evaluating censorship circumvention tools</li>
<li>Those who work on the wider implications of censorship, bringing perspectives from the worlds of policy, law, ethics, and political and social sciences</li>
</ul>

<p>This second workshop aims to repeat and promote this critical interdisciplinary approach.</p>

<p>Six-page short-paper submissions are due April 26 ( <strong>edit: May 3</strong> ), and the workshop is August 6 near Seattle. See <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci12/calls-for-papers">the full Call for Papers</a> for details.</p>

	      <p>Interested in coding on Tor and getting paid for it by Google? If you are a student, we have good news for you: We have been <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2012">accepted</a> as a mentoring organization for <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">Google Summer of Code 2012</a> together with <a href="https://www.eff.org/">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>! Woo!</p>

<p>Here are the facts: The summer of code gives you the opportunity to work on your own Tor-related coding project with one of the Tor developers as your mentor. You can apply for a coding project related to Tor itself or to one of its many <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Projects">supplemental projects</a> (as well as for an <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HTTPSEverywhere/GSOC-2012">EFF-related project</a>). Your mentor will help you when you&#39;re stuck with your project and guide you in becoming part of the Tor community. Google pays you 5,000 USD for the three months of your project, so that you can focus on coding and don&#39;t have to worry about how to pay your bills.</p>

<p>Did we catch your attention? These are your next steps: Go look at the <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs">Google Summer of Code FAQ</a> to make sure you are eligible to participate. Have a look at our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/gsoc.html.en#Ideas">ideas list</a> to see if one of those projects matches your interests. If there is no project on that list that you&#39;d want to work on, read the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/documentation.html.en">documentation on our website</a> and make up your own project idea! Come to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/contact.html.en#irc">#tor-dev on OFTC</a> and let us know about your project idea. Communication is essential to success in the summer of code, and we&#39;re unlikely to accept students we haven&#39;t heard from before reading their application. So really, come to the IRC channel and talk to us!</p>

<p>Finally, write down your project idea using our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/gsoc.html.en#Template">template</a> and <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs#student_apply">submit your application</a> to Google until <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2012">April 6, 2012</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to discussing your project idea with you!</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Although Tor was originally designed to enhance privacy, the network is increasingly being used to provide access to websites from countries where Internet connectivity is filtered. To better support this goal, Tor introduced the feature of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges">bridge nodes</a> – Tor nodes which route traffic but are not published in the list of available Tor nodes. Consequently bridges are commonly not blocked in countries where access to the public Tor nodes are (with the exception of China and Iran).</p>

<p>For bridge nodes to work well, we need lots of them. This is both to make it hard to block them all, and also to provide enough bandwidth capacity for all their users. To help achieve this goal, the Tor Browser Bundle now makes it as easy as clicking a button to turn a normal Tor client into a bridge. The upcoming version of Tor will even set up port forwarding on home routers (through UPnP and NAT-PMP) to make it easier still.</p>

<p>There are, however, potential risks to Tor users if they turn their client into a bridge. These were summarized in a paper by Jon McLachlan and Nicholas Hopper: <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ehopper/surf_and_serve.pdf">&quot;On the risks of serving whenever you surf&quot;</a>. I discussed these risks in a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/risks-serving-whenever-you-surf">previous blog post</a>, along with ways to mitigate them. In this blog post I&#39;ll cover some initiatives the Tor project is working on (or considering), which could further reduce the risks.</p>

<p>The attack than McLachlan and Hopper propose involves finding a list of bridges, and then probing them over time. If the bridge responds at all, then we know that the bridge operator could be surfing the web though Tor. So, if the attacker suspects that a blogger is posting through Tor and the blogger&#39;s Tor client is also a bridge, then only the bridges which are running at the time a blog post was written could belong to the blogger. There are likely to be quite a few such bridges, but if the attack is repeated, the set of potential bridge IP addresses will be narrowed down.</p>

<p>What is more, the paper also proposes measuring how quickly each bridge responds, which might tell the attacker something about how heavily the bridge operator is using their Tor client. If the attacker probes the rest of the Tor network, and sees a node with performance patterns similar to the bridge being probed, then it is likely that there is a connection going through that node and that bridge. In some circumstances this attack could be used to track connections all the way through the Tor network, and back to a client who is also acting as a bridge.</p>

<p>One way of reducing the risk of these attacks succeeding is to run the bridge on a device which is always on. In this case, just because a bridge is running doesn&#39;t mean the operator is using Tor. Therefore less information is leaked to a potential attacker. As laptops become more prevalent, keeping a bridge on 24/7 can be inconvenient so the Tor Project is working on two bits of hardware (known as <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter">Torouters</a>) which can be left running a bridge even if the user&#39;s computer is off. If someone probes the bridge now, they can&#39;t learn much about whether the operator is using Tor as a client, and so it leaks less information about what the user is doing.</p>

<p>Having an always-on bridge helps resist profiling based on when a client is on. However, evaluating the risk of profiling based on bridge performance is more complex. The reason this attack works is that when a node is congested, increasing traffic on one connection (say, due to the bridge operator using Tor) decreases the traffic on another (say, the attacker probing the bridge). If you run a Tor client on your PC, and a Tor bridge on a separate device, this reduces the opportunity for congestion on one leading to congestion on the other. However, there is still the possibility for congestion on the network connection which the bridge and device share, and maybe you do want to use the bridge device as a client too. So the Torouter helps, but doesn&#39;t fix the problem.</p>

<p>To fully decouple bridges from clients, they need to run on different hardware <strong>and networks</strong> . Here the <a href="https://cloud.torproject.org/">Tor Cloud</a> project is ideal – bridges run on Amazon&#39;s (or another cloud provider&#39;s) infrastructure so congestion on the bridge can&#39;t affect the Tor client running on your PC, or it&#39;s network.</p>

<p>But maybe you do want to use your bridge as a client for whatever reason. Recall that the first step of the attack proposed by McLachlan and Hopper is to find the bridges&#39; IP addresses. This is becoming increasingly difficult as more bridges are being set up. Also, there is work in progress to make it harder to scan networks for bridges. Originally this was intended to make it harder to find and block bridges, but it applies equally well to preventing probing. These schemes (e.g. <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/%7Eiang/pubs/bridgespa-wpes.pdf">BridgeSPA</a> by Smits et. al.) mean that just because you have a bridge&#39;s IP address, it doesn&#39;t mean that you can route traffic through it (to measure performance) or even check if the bridge is running. To do either, you need to have a secret which is distributed only to authorized users of the bridge.</p>

<p>There is still more work to be done in protecting bridge operators, but the projects discussed above (and in the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/risks-serving-whenever-you-surf">previous blog post</a>) certainly improve the situation. Work continues both in academia and at the Tor Project to better understand the problem and develop further fixes.</p>
