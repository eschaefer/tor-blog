	      <p>Nick encouraged me to rewrite TorCheck in Python. Roger encouraged me to automatically translate TorCheck messages into a given locale when specifically requested. This is finished, reasonably stable and live right now.</p>

<p>As usual, TorCheck queries the <a href="http://exitlist.torproject.org/">TorDNSEL</a> to determine if the visitor is possibly using a proper Tor exit node.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, TorCheck is now localized with useful information in <a href="//check.torproject.org/?lang=pt_BR">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, <a href="https://check.torproject.org/?lang=zh_CN">Chinese</a>, <a href="//check.torproject.org/?lang=en_US">English</a>, <a href="//check.torproject.org/?lang=de">German</a>, <a href="//check.torproject.org/?lang=fa_IR">Farsi</a>, <a href="//check.torproject.org/?lang=ja">Japanese</a>, <a href="https://check.torproject.org/?lang=pl">Polish</a> and <a href="https://check.torproject.org/?lang=es_ES">Spanish</a>.</p>

<p>Users of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/">TorBrowser</a> will now automatically have a fully translated browsing experience. Any other user can simply select the proper ISO 3166 Code for their country and make a GET request with a properly set LANG query string as linked above. There&#39;s a good chance that your locale will be supported in the future if it isn&#39;t already.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to pitch in and translate TorCheck into your locale, we&#39;d love the help! Feel free to <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/check/trunk/i18n/">check the translations directory for current translations</a> and see if your locale has been translated. If you&#39;d like to add a locale we haven&#39;t translated, download a copy of <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/check/trunk/i18n/TorCheck.pot">the PO template file</a> and translate away!</p>

<p>Give the new <a href="https://check.torproject.org">TorCheck</a> a try today!</p>

	      <p>Tor 0.2.0.23-rc (released Mar 24) is the fourth release candidate for the 0.2.0 series. It makes bootstrapping faster if the first directory mirror you contact is down. The bundles also include the new Vidalia 0.1.2 release.
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00204.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00204.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00204.html</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.22-rc (released Mar 18) is the third release candidate for the 0.2.0 series. It enables encrypted directory connections by default for non-relays, fixes some broken TLS behavior we added in 0.2.0.20-rc, and resolves many other bugs. The bundles also include Vidalia 0.1.1 and Torbutton 1.1.17.
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00136.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00136.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00136.html</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.21-rc (released Mar 2) is the second release candidate for the 0.2.0 series. It makes Tor work well with Vidalia again, fixes a rare assert bug, and fixes a pair of more minor bugs. The bundles also include Vidalia 0.1.0 and Torbutton 1.1.16.
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00025.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00025.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2008/msg00025.html</a></p>

<p>Torbutton 1.1.16 (released Mar 3) and 1.1.17 (released Mar 15) fix many more potential privacy and identity leaks, mostly based on exploits found by Greg Fleischer, and try to start adding support for Firefox 3.
 <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG" title="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG">https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<p>Vidalia 0.1.0 (released Mar 1), 0.1.1 (released Mar 17), and 0.1.2 (released Mar 24) changes the build process from make to cmake, starts doing encrypted geoip fetches rather than plaintext geoip fetches, checks if the user is running a dangerous or obsolete version of Tor and pops up a window warning them, waits to turn the Vidalia taskbar onion green until Tor reports that it has established a circuit, folds in the patches from Tor Browser Bundle to have Vidalia launch a browser and/or an http proxy, and fixes many miscellaneous bugs.
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.2/CHANGELOG" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.2/CHANGELOG">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/tags/vidalia-0.1.2/CHANG...</a></p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.23-rc ChangeLog:
“When a tunneled directory request is made to a directory server that&#39;s down, notice after 30 seconds rather than 120 seconds. Also, fail any begindir streams that are pending on it, so they can retry elsewhere. This was causing multi-minute delays on bootstrap.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.22-rc ChangeLog:
“Enable encrypted directory connections by default for non-relays, so censor tools that block Tor directory connections based on their plaintext patterns will no longer work. This means Tor works in certain censored countries by default again.”</p>

<p>From the Vidalia 0.1.1 ChangeLog:
“TunnelDirConns and PreferTunneledDirConns are now enabled by default as of Tor 0.2.0.22-rc. Don&#39;t check the &#39;My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network&#39; box simply because TunnelDirConns is enabled. Checking the box still enables encrypted directory connections on older Tors.”</p>

<p>From the Vidlia 0.1.0 ChangeLog:
“Listen for the DANGEROUS_VERSION general status event and warn the user if their version of Tor is no longer recommended.”
“Listen for the CIRCUIT_ESTABLISHED client status event and only turn the yellow onion status icon green after Tor has successfully established a circuit.”
“Add a &quot;How do I find a bridge?&quot; link and corresponding help text to the &#39;Network&#39; settings page.”
“Add a &#39;BrowserExecutable&#39; configuration option to launch a Web browser when Tor has built a circuit, and exit Vidalia when the browser is closed.”
“Add &#39;ProxyExecutable&#39; and &#39;ProxyExecutableArguments&#39; configuration options to launch a proxy application with given parameters when Vidalia starts, and close it when Vidalia exits.”
“Rename the &#39;Relay&#39; settings page to the &#39;Sharing&#39; settings page.”</p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.21-rc ChangeLog:
“We were sometimes miscounting the number of bytes read from the network, causing our rate limiting to not be followed exactly. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by lodger.”</p>

<p>From the Vidalia 0.1.2 ChangeLog:
“Bridges are no longer required to have a DirPort set as of Tor 0.2.0.13-alpha, so stop forcing it on for bridges. At some point, we&#39;ll likely start forcing DirPort to be disabled for bridges, and on by default but optional for normal relays.”</p>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.0.0 (released Mar 20) and 1.0.1 (released Mar 26) makes it work correctly with Polipo again, updates the versions of many of its components, and makes it easier to build the Bundle with custom included &quot;jar&quot; (plug-in) files as well as &quot;xpi&quot; (extension) files.

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>In early January after 24C3, I travelled to Stuttgart to meet with the police there. I spoke to about 30 or 40 investigators. My goal wasn&#39;t to advocate for any particular laws or policies (that&#39;s up to them, after all), but rather to help give them background so they can make more informed decisions: explain who uses Tor and how it works, and try to answer any questions that come up. In particular, my goals were to open a discussion about the data retention laws, and also brainstorm how German Tor operators and German law enforcement can get along better.</p>

<p>It turns out that the fellow who did the September 2006 seizures was part of this group, and he was very interested to talk to me and learn more about Tor.</p>

<p>They explained that the data retention laws *they&#39;d* asked for were basically that large ISPs should be required to answer them when they ask who had a given IP address at a given time (data the ISPs already keep for the most part), and as a bonus, it would be nice if they paid somebody to answer the requests on weekends too. The law that they got was way more than that, and they don&#39;t need or want most of it.</p>

<p>I tried to get them to be more public about the fact that they don&#39;t need most of the law they got, but they explained that there was a process, and their role was to tell the authorities what new powers they need. Now it&#39;s up to other folks (like the CCC) to make sure that the final version of the law isn&#39;t too bad.</p>

<p>And I can understand why they&#39;re reluctant to speak against it. First, there are probably political problems with publically disagreeing with the folks in charge. And second, they really do want the powers they asked for, and they worry that if they speak up then the whole thing might be killed.</p>

<p>Overall, they were nice and reasonable people. We left with three takeaway plans:</p>

<p>1) Tor should expand its exitlist.torproject.org system so there&#39;s an interface for asking &quot;was this IP address a Tor exit relay in the past few months?&quot; The goal is to give them an easy way to answer the question &quot;is it not worth breaking down another door?&quot; which will save them time and save Tor operators hassle.
2) They thought it was quite clear that Tor relays weren&#39;t included as &quot;server providers&quot; in the upcoming data retention laws. They offered to talk to a state prosecutor in their area to try to get a public statement to that effect. I&#39;m not optimistic (it&#39;s hard to ever get the government to publically say anything), but that&#39;s a fine start.
3) They will tell other German police groups about me, and maybe I&#39;ll visit others at some point.</p>
