	      <p>Tor 0.2.1.22 rotates two of the seven v3 directory authority keys and
locations, due to a security breach of some of the Torproject servers:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00161.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00161.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00161.html</a></p>

<p>It also fixes a privacy problem in bridge directory authorities -- it
would tell you its whole history of bridge descriptors if you make the
right directory request.</p>

<p>Everybody should upgrade:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.22 - 2010-01-19
 o Directory authority changes:
 - Rotate keys (both v3 identity and relay identity) for moria1
 and gabelmoo.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes:
 - Stop bridge directory authorities from answering dbg-stability.txt
 directory queries, which would let people fetch a list of all
 bridge identities they track. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</p>

	      <p>I attended the speech given by Secretary Clinton on Jan 21, 2010, <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm" title="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm">http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm</a>. Most of it was a rehashing of what many of us already know and believe, but it&#39;s still good to hear the US Govt &quot;gets it&quot; and is trying to promote the openness on which the Internet has thrived. You can watch the full speech at <a href="http://netfreedom.state.gov" title="http://netfreedom.state.gov">http://netfreedom.state.gov</a>. Interestingly, someone got to ask the anonymity question before me,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>QUESTION: You talked about anonymity on line and how we have to prevent that. But you also talk about censorship by governments. And I’m struck by – having a veil of anonymity in certain situations is actually quite beneficial. So are you looking to strike a balance between that and this emphasis on censorship?</p>

<p>SECRETARY CLINTON: Absolutely. I mean, this is one of the challenges we face. On the one hand, anonymity protects the exploitation of children. And on the other hand, anonymity protects the free expression of opposition to repressive governments. Anonymity allows the theft of intellectual property, but anonymity also permits people to come together in settings that gives them some basis for free expression without identifying themselves.</p>

<p>None of this will be easy. I think that’s a fair statement. I think, as I said, we all have varying needs and rights and responsibilities. But I think these overriding principles should be our guiding light. We should err on the side of openness and do everything possible to create that, recognizing, as with any rule or any statement of principle, there are going to be exceptions.</p>

<p>So how we go after this, I think, is now what we’re requesting many of you who are experts in this area to lend your help to us in doing. We need the guidance of technology experts. In my experience, most of them are younger than 40, but not all are younger than 40. And we need the companies that do this, and we need the dissident voices who have actually lived on the front lines so that we can try to work through the best way to make that balance you referred to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is good that she tries to balance the good versus evil, but believes that &quot;we should err on the side of openness and do everything possible to create that&quot;. I also think she mixes anonymity, anonymous speech, and an open internet as if they were all one. We&#39;re happy to help clarify and explain how Tor and anonymity online can be beneficial.</p>

<p>I never did find the person who asked the question, he at least deserves a Tor sticker. ;)</p>

	      <p>You should upgrade to Tor 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7-alpha:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en</a></p>

<p>In early January we discovered that two of the seven servers that run directory
authorities were compromised (moria1 and gabelmoo), along with
metrics.torproject.org, a new server we&#39;d recently set up to serve
metrics data and graphs. The three servers have since been reinstalled
with service migrated to other servers.</p>

<p>We made fresh identity keys for the two directory authorities, which is
why you need to upgrade.</p>

<p>Moria also hosted our git repository and svn repository. We took the
services offline as soon as we learned of the breach. It appears the
attackers didn&#39;t realize what they broke into -- just that they had
found some servers with lots of bandwidth. The attackers set up some ssh
keys and proceeded to use the three servers for launching other attacks.
We&#39;ve done some preliminary comparisons, and it looks like git and svn
were not touched in any way.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been very lucky the past few years regarding security. It still
seems this breach is unrelated to Tor itself. To be clear, it doesn&#39;t
seem that anyone specifically attacked our servers to get at Tor. It
seems we were attacked for the cpu capacity and bandwidth of the servers,
and the servers just happened to also carry out functions for Tor.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve tried to address the most common questions below.</p>

<p><strong>I read that Tor&#39;s encryption keys were compromised, is this true?</strong></p>

<p>No. The operating systems were compromised, not tor. The tor source, and running Tor Directory Authorities were left untouched. It appears the
attackers didn&#39;t realize what they broke into -- just that they had
found some servers with lots of bandwidth. We&#39;ve generated new Directory Authority keys out of an abundance of caution.</p>

<p><strong>Does this mean someone could have matched users up to their
destinations?</strong></p>

<p>No. By design, Tor requires a majority of directory authorities (four
in this case) to generate a consensus; and like other relays in the
Tor network, directory authorities don&#39;t know enough to match a user
and traffic or destination.</p>

<p><strong>Does this mean somebody could have changed the Tor source?</strong></p>

<p>No, we&#39;ve checked the source. It does mean you should upgrade so your
client knows about all the currently valid directory authorities.</p>

<p>** Does this mean someone could have learned more about Tor than an
ordinary user?**</p>

<p>Since our software and specifications are open, everyone already has
access to almost everything on these machines... except some old bridge
descriptors, which we give out only in small batches as entry points for
blocked clients.</p>

<p><strong>Can I trust Tor&#39;s security?</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve taken steps to fix the weaknesses identified and to harden our
systems further. Tor has a track record of openness and transparency,
with its source code and specifications and also with its operations.
Moreover, we&#39;re disclosing breaches such as this so you can monitor our
status. You shouldn&#39;t assume those who don&#39;t disclose security breaches
never have any!</p>

	      <p>Over the past few months, a number of exit relay operators have contacted us asking for help with some legal issues encountered while running their relay. While we can&#39;t provide legal advice in all jurisdictions, we can frequently find you a next hop in the legal chain to get you the advice or representation you need. Sometimes this advice is free/pro-bono, other times it is not. It&#39;s up to the legal organization to decide if they can take your case or refer you to someone else.</p>

<p>Rather than keep a secret list of people willing to help, we&#39;re building a public list for operators to contact directly, in their own country. A big thanks to Fred and Gwen at the EFF for helping to start this list and for making introductions. And, of course, a big thanks to the organizations for agreeing to be listed and for offering support to Tor relay operators.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to add your name to this list, please let me know.</p>
