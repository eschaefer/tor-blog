          <p>Vidalia is the graphical controller for the Tor software. It provides an easy to use interface to control some basic functionality of the Tor software and to give you graphical feedback as to what your Tor software is doing as you use it.</p>

<p>The Vidalia Project is shutting down the server that gives you the city-level location for tor relays in the Network Map. If you are running a version of Vidalia that is earlier than 0.2.10, you will lose your country flags and relays appearing in the Network Map. This is a display issue and does not affect the functionality of the Tor software itself. The main change in Vidalia 0.2.10 was to rely on the Tor software&#39;s local country-level GeoIP database that ships with the Tor software.</p>

<p>Running geoip.vidalia-project.net saved us from including a large database within the packages. The Tor software packages include a small country-level database which works fine for this Network Map display purpose. The Tor software&#39;s database provides country-level resolution, so you&#39;ll still know where your relay and circuits are traveling around the globe.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve lost your flags in Vidalia, upgrade to 0.2.10. Vidalia itself can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/" title="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/">https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/</a>. All packages we maintain have been updated with Vidalia 0.2.10. See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a> for more options.</p>

          <p>The latest version of the graphical controller for tor, Vidalia, is now available. The main change is the use of Tor&#39;s native geoip database to map relay IP addresses to country. This removes the remote geoip resolution that occurred over Tor in previous versions of Vidalia.</p>

<p>Vidalia can be found at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/" title="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/">https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/</a>.</p>

<p>The full changelog is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop remote GeoIP lookups. Instead, the default behavior now is to use the country-level GeoIP database that ships with Tor to map an IP address to a country code, and then map the country code to latitude and longitude with a separate database built into Vidalia.</li>
<li>Add a -DUSE_GEOIP build option to enable building with MaxMind&#39;s GeoIP C library for using a local city-level or country-level database instead of Tor&#39;s database. See README.geoip for details on use.</li>
<li>Only update a stream&#39;s displayed target address in the network map if no hostname was given in the stream&#39;s NEW status event. Fix suggested by Robert Hogan. (Ticket #608)</li>
<li>Update the menubar icon at the same time as the dock icon on OS X. Previously, we had a blank icon in the menubar. (Ticket #610)</li>
<li>Updated several translations.</li>

          <p>Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha fixes a variety of old stream fairness bugs (most
evident at exit relays), and also continues to resolve all the little
bugs that have been filling up the bug tracker lately.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en</a></p>

<p>Packages will be appearing over the next few days or weeks (except
on Windows, which apparently doesn&#39;t build -- stay tuned for an
0.2.2.17-alpha in that case).</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.16-alpha - 2010-09-17
 o Major bugfixes (stream-level fairness):
 - When receiving a circuit-level SENDME for a blocked circuit, try
 to package cells fairly from all the streams that had previously
 been blocked on that circuit. Previously, we had started with the
 oldest stream, and allowed each stream to potentially exhaust
 the circuit&#39;s package window. This gave older streams on any
 given circuit priority over newer ones. Fixes bug 1937. Detected
 originally by Camilo Viecco. This bug was introduced before the
 first Tor release, in svn commit r152: it is the new winner of
 the longest-lived bug prize.
 - When the exit relay got a circuit-level sendme cell, it started
 reading on the exit streams, even if had 500 cells queued in the
 circuit queue already, so the circuit queue just grew and grew in
 some cases. We fix this by not re-enabling reading on receipt of a
 sendme cell when the cell queue is blocked. Fixes bug 1653. Bugfix
 on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Detected by Mashael AlSabah. Original patch by
 &quot;yetonetime&quot;.
 - Newly created streams were allowed to read cells onto circuits,
 even if the circuit&#39;s cell queue was blocked and waiting to drain.
 This created potential unfairness, as older streams would be
 blocked, but newer streams would gladly fill the queue completely.
 We add code to detect this situation and prevent any stream from
 getting more than one free cell. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Partially
 fixes bug 1298.</p>

<p>o Minor features:
 - Update to the September 1 2010 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
 - Warn when CookieAuthFileGroupReadable is set but CookieAuthFile is
 not. This would lead to a cookie that is still not group readable.
 Closes bug 1843. Suggested by katmagic.
 - When logging a rate-limited warning, we now mention how many messages
 got suppressed since the last warning.
 - Add new &quot;perconnbwrate&quot; and &quot;perconnbwburst&quot; consensus params to
 do individual connection-level rate limiting of clients. The torrc
 config options with the same names trump the consensus params, if
 both are present. Replaces the old &quot;bwconnrate&quot; and &quot;bwconnburst&quot;
 consensus params which were broken from 0.2.2.7-alpha through
 0.2.2.14-alpha. Closes bug 1947.
 - When a router changes IP address or port, authorities now launch
 a new reachability test for it. Implements ticket 1899.
 - Make the formerly ugly &quot;2 unknown, 7 missing key, 0 good, 0 bad,
 2 no signature, 4 required&quot; messages about consensus signatures
 easier to read, and make sure they get logged at the same severity
 as the messages explaining which keys are which. Fixes bug 1290.
 - Don&#39;t warn when we have a consensus that we can&#39;t verify because
 of missing certificates, unless those certificates are ones
 that we have been trying and failing to download. Fixes bug 1145.
 - If you configure your bridge with a known identity fingerprint,
 and the bridge authority is unreachable (as it is in at least
 one country now), fall back to directly requesting the descriptor
 from the bridge. Finishes the feature started in 0.2.0.10-alpha;
 closes bug 1138.
 - When building with --enable-gcc-warnings on OpenBSD, disable
 warnings in system headers. This makes --enable-gcc-warnings
 pass on OpenBSD 4.8.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x and earlier):
 - Authorities will now attempt to download consensuses if their
 own efforts to make a live consensus have failed. This change
 means authorities that restart will fetch a valid consensus, and
 it means authorities that didn&#39;t agree with the current consensus
 will still fetch and serve it if it has enough signatures. Bugfix
 on 0.2.0.9-alpha; fixes bug 1300.
 - Ensure DNS requests launched by &quot;RESOLVE&quot; commands from the
 controller respect the __LeaveStreamsUnattached setconf options. The
 same goes for requests launched via DNSPort or transparent
 proxying. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 1525.
 - Allow handshaking OR connections to take a full KeepalivePeriod
 seconds to handshake. Previously, we would close them after
 IDLE_OR_CONN_TIMEOUT (180) seconds, the same timeout as if they
 were open. Bugfix on 0.2.1.26; fixes bug 1840. Thanks to mingw-san
 for analysis help.
 - Rate-limit &quot;Failed to hand off onionskin&quot; warnings.
 - Never relay a cell for a circuit we have already destroyed.
 Between marking a circuit as closeable and finally closing it,
 it may have been possible for a few queued cells to get relayed,
 even though they would have been immediately dropped by the next
 OR in the circuit. Fixes bug 1184; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
 - Never queue a cell for a circuit that&#39;s already been marked
 for close.
 - Never vote for a server as &quot;Running&quot; if we have a descriptor for
 it claiming to be hibernating, and that descriptor was published
 more recently than our last contact with the server. Bugfix on
 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 911.
 - Squash a compile warning on OpenBSD. Reported by Tas; fixes
 bug 1848.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):
 - Fix a regression introduced in 0.2.2.7-alpha that marked relays
 down if a directory fetch fails and you&#39;ve configured either
 bridges or EntryNodes. The intent was to mark the relay as down
 _unless_ you&#39;re using bridges or EntryNodes, since if you are
 then you could quickly run out of entry points.
 - Fix the Windows directory-listing code. A bug introduced in
 0.2.2.14-alpha could make Windows directory servers forget to load
 some of their cached v2 networkstatus files.
 - Really allow clients to use relays as bridges. Fixes bug 1776;
 bugfix on 0.2.2.15-alpha.
 - Demote a warn to info that happens when the CellStatistics option
 was just enabled. Bugfix on 0.2.2.15-alpha; fixes bug 1921.
 Reported by Moritz Bartl.
 - On Windows, build correctly either with or without Unicode support.
 This is necessary so that Tor can support fringe platforms like
 Windows 98 (which has no Unicode), or Windows CE (which has no
 non-Unicode). Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug 1797.</p>

<p>o Testing
 - Add a unit test for cross-platform directory-listing code.</p>

          <p>Looking for a paper topic (or a thesis topic)? Here&#39;s a Tor research area that needs more attention. The short version is: if we prevent the really loud users from using too much of the Tor network, how much can it help?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve instrumented Tor&#39;s entry relays so they can rate-limit connections from users, and we&#39;ve instrumented the directory authorities so they can change the rate-limiting parameters globally across the network. Which parameter values improve performance for the Tor network as a whole? How should relays adapt their rate-limiting parameters based on their capacity and based on the network load they see, and what rate-limiting algorithms will work best?</p>

<p>We&#39;d love to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/research">work with you</a> to help answer these questions.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>One of the reasons why Tor is slow is that some people use it for file-sharing or other high-volume transfers. That means if you want to get your instant message cell through, it sometimes needs to wait in line behind a pile of other cells — leading to high latency and, maybe even worse, highly variable latency.</p>

<p>One way to improve the situation is Can and Goldberg&#39;s <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/%7Eiang/pubs/ewma-ccs.pdf">&quot;An Improved Algorithm for Tor Circuit Scheduling&quot;</a>, to be presented next month at ACM CCS 2010 and already integrated into Tor as of 0.2.2.11-alpha. The idea is to track how many cells the relay has handled for each circuit lately, and give priority to cells from quieter circuits.</p>

<p>But while that puts some cells in front of others, it can only work so many miracles: if many cells have been placed in front of your cell it still has to wait, and the more overall load there is in the network, the more often that will happen.</p>

<p>Which leads to the research problem: if we work to keep the really loud flows off the network in the first place, how much can it help?</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha lets you set the PerConnBWRate and PerConnBWBurst config options in your relay, to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket">token buckets</a> to rate limit connections from non-relays. Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha added the capability for the directory authorities to broadcast network-wide token bucket parameters, so we can change how much throttling there is and then observe the results on the network.</p>

<p>So the first question is to model how this should work to improve performance at a single entry guard. Say we do periodic performance tests fetching files of size 50KB, 1MB, and 5MB using that relay as our first hop, and say the relay sets PerConnBWRate to 5KB/s and PerConnBWBurst to 2MB. That is, bursts of up to 2 megabytes on the connection are unthrottled, but after that it&#39;s squeezed to a long-term average of 5 kilobytes per second, until the flow lets up at which point the allowed burst slowly builds back up to 2MB. We would expect the 5MB tests to show horrible performance, since they&#39;ll need at least 3000/5=600 seconds to fetch the last 3MB of the file. We would expect the 50KB and 1MB tests to look <em>better</em>, though: if we&#39;re squeezing out the really big flows, there&#39;s more space for what&#39;s left.</p>

<p>We actually performed this <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1750">experiment</a>, using Sebastian&#39;s relay fluxe3. You can see here his performance graphs over time. The black dots are individual fetches, the y axis is how many seconds it took to fetch the file, and the x axis is time (the green-shaded areas are when the feature is turned on). Don&#39;t pay too much attention to the blue smoothing line; it&#39;s probably not matching the actual distribution well.</p>

<p><a href="http://sebastianhahn.net/tor/torperf.png"><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/1750-torperf-experiment3.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Here are the cumulative distribution functions for the same data. The performance gets significantly better both for the 50KB and the 1MB downloads, and as expected gets significantly worse for the 5MB downloads:</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/attachment/ticket/1750/torperf-experiment-ecdf.png"><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/1750-torperf-experiment-ecdf2.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the raw data: <a href="http://siv.sunet.se/sebastian/50kb.data">50kb</a>, <a href="http://siv.sunet.se/sebastian/1mb.data">1mb</a>, <a href="http://siv.sunet.se/sebastian/5mb.data">5mb</a>. See the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torperf.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/measurements-HOWTO">Torperf howto</a> for help interpreting it.</p>

<p>So far so good; we&#39;ve done the proof of concept, and now we need a research group to step in, make it rigorous, and help tackle the real research questions.</p>

<p>The next question is: how well does this trick work under various conditions? It would seem that if there&#39;s plenty of spare bandwidth on the relay, it should have little effect. If we choose parameters that are too lenient, it also would have little effect. But choosing parameters that are too low will hurt normal web browsing users too. Are there rate and burst values that would cleanly separate web browsers from bulk downloaders? Will certain relays (that is, relays with certain characteristics) provide clearer performance improvements than others?</p>

<p>How often is it the case, for various relay capacities and various user loads, that at least one connection is being throttled? The CDFs appear to show improved performance spread out pretty evenly relative to download time. What statistics should we make relays track over time so we can get a better intuition about the load they&#39;re really seeing?</p>

<p>Now is where it gets tricky. If we&#39;re only thinking about one relay turning on this feature in a vacuum, then if that relay has enough capacity to handle all its flows, it should — no sense slowing down <em>anybody</em> if you can handle all the traffic. But instead think of the entire Tor network as a system: your Tor requests might also slow down because a loud Tor flow entered at some other relay and is colliding with yours somewhere along the path. So there&#39;s a reason to squeeze incoming connections even if you have enough capacity to handle them: to reduce the effects of bottlenecks elsewhere in the system. If all relays squeeze client connections, what changes in the performance test results do we expect to see for various rate limiting parameter values?</p>

<p>We have the capability of doing network-wide experiments to validate your theory, by putting the rate and burst in the hourly networkstatus consensus and letting relays pick it up from there. That is, you can modify the global network-wide parameters and then observe the effects in the network. Note that the experiment will be complicated by the fact that only relays running a sufficiently recent version of Tor will honor the parameters; that fraction should increase significantly when Tor 0.2.2.x becomes the new stable release (sometime in late 2010).</p>

<p>And finally, once you have a good intuition about how throttling flows at point X affects flow performance at point Y, we get to the really hard research questions. It&#39;s probably the case that no fixed network-wide rate limiting parameters are going to provide optimal behavior: the parameters ought to be a function of the load patterns on the network and of the capacity of the given relay. Should relays track the flows they&#39;ve seen recently and adapt their throttling parameters over time? Is there some flow distribution that relays can learn the parameters of, such that we e.g. throttle the loudest 10% of flows? Can we approximate optimal behavior when relays base their parameters on only the local behavior they see, or do we need a more global view of the system to choose good parameters? And what does &quot;optimal&quot; mean here anyway? Or said another way, how much flexibility do we have to define optimal, or do the facts here railroad us into prefering certain definitions?</p>

<p>What are the anonymity implications of letting the behavior of user A influence the performance of user B, in the local-view case or the global-view case? We could imagine active attacks that aim to influence the parameters; can those impact anonymity?</p>

<p>As a nice side effect, this feature may provide a defense against Sambuddho&#39;s <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/%7Eastavrou/research/timing_esorics10.pdf">bandwidth-based link congestion attack</a>, which relies on a sustained high-volume flow — if the attack ever gets precise enough that we can try out our defense and compare.</p>

<p>Here are some other constraints to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We need the Burst to be big enough to handle directory fetches (up to a megabyte or two), or things will get really ugly because clients will get slowed down while bootstrapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Mike&#39;s <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torflow-node-capacity-integrity-and-reliability-measurements-hotpets">bandwidth authority</a> measurement <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torflow/trunk/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.BwAuthorities">scripts</a> send traffic over relays to discover their actual capacity relative to their advertised capacity. The larger the claimed capacity, the more they send — up to several megabytes for the fast relays. If relays throttle these bandwidth tests, the directory authorities will assign less traffic to them, making them appear to provide better performance when in fact they&#39;re just being less useful to the network. This is an example of a case where it would be easy to misinterpret your results if you don&#39;t understand the rest of the Tor system. A short-term workaround would be to turn the bandwidth authority Tors into relays so they don&#39;t get throttled.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll want to do experiments on an established relay with the Guard flag, or it probably won&#39;t see many client connections except for clients fetching directory updates. Note that the longer a relay has had the Guard flag, the more users it will have attracted; but after a month this effect falls off.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking from an economic perspective, it may turn out that the performance for a given user doesn&#39;t actually get better if we throttle the high-volume users, yet we&#39;ve still improved things. That is, if the available capacity of the Tor network improves and thus it is supporting more users, we&#39;ve made a better Tor network even if we didn&#39;t make it faster for individual users. Fortunately, this feedback effect shouldn&#39;t happen for short-term experiments; but it&#39;s something to keep in mind for the long term.</p></li>
<li><p>It sure would be nice if whatever rate limiting algorithm you recommend is efficient to calculate and update over time. Some relays are seeing tens of thousands of users, and can&#39;t afford much processing time on each.</p></li>

          <p>As more countries crack down on Internet use, people around the world are turning to anti-censorship software that lets them reach blocked websites. Many types of software, also known as circumvention tools, have been created to answer the threat to freedom online. These tools provide different features and levels of security, and it&#39;s important for users to understand the tradeoffs.</p>

<p>This article lays out ten features you should consider when evaluating a circumvention tool. The goal isn&#39;t to advocate for any specific tool, but to point out what kind of tools are useful for different situations.</p>
