          <p><strong>New releases</strong>
On May 25, we released Tor 0.2.1.15-rc.
On May 17, we released Tor VM 0.0.2.
On May 25, we released Vidalia 0.1.13 containing</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove an old warning on the relay settings page that running a bridge
relay requires Tor 0.2.0.8-alpha or newer.</li>
<li>Add a workaround for a bug that prevented Vidalia&#39;s tray icon from
getting added to the system notification area on Gnome when Vidalia was
run on system startup. Patch by Steve Tyree. (Ticket #247)</li>
<li>Fix a bug that prevented the control panel from displaying when
running on the Enlightenment window manager. Patch by Steve Tyree.</li>
<li>Rename the CMake variables used to store the location of Qt&#39;s lupdate
and lrelease executables. Recent versions of CMake decided to use the
same variable name, which was stomping on mine, resulting in the wrong
lupdate and lrelease executables being used.</li>
<li>Use the TorProcess subclass of QProcess for launching Tor when hashing
a control password so we can take advantage of its PATH+=:/usr/sbin
trick on Debian there too.</li>
<li>If a RouterDescriptor object is empty, don&#39;t try to display it in the
router descriptor details viewer. (Ticket #479)</li>
<li>Wait until Vidalia has registered for log events via the control port
before ignoring Tor&#39;s output on stdout. Previously we would start
ignoring Tor&#39;s stdout after successfully authenticating, but before
registering for log events which, in some cases, could lead to
messages not appearing in the message log.</li>
<li>Update many translations and remove others than are no longer
up-to-date enough to be useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>On May 25th, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.0 containing</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch to launching Firefox directly from Vidalia to
allow multiple instances of Firefox</li>
<li>Update Firefox to 3.0.10</li>
<li>Update to Qt 4.5.1</li>
<li>Update Firefox prefs.js to stop scanning for plugins</li>
<li>Update libevent to 1.4.11</li>
<li>Include the Tor geoip database</li>
<li>Update Vidalia to 0.1.13</li>
<li>Update Tor to 0.2.1.15-rc</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better
tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<p>Matt added &quot;fetch bridges&quot; features to Vidalia 0.2.x. This provides a link to automatically request bridges from <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org" title="https://bridges.torproject.org">https://bridges.torproject.org</a> for users.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture and technical design docs for Tor enhancements
related to blocking-resistance.</strong>
Proposal 160 aims to let authorities modify the bandwidth they put in
the consensus for each relay. This step will allow us to adjust the
weights we advertise for clients, once the measurements from TorFlow
start giving us better weights.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/160-bandwidth-offset.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/160-bandwidth-offset.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/160-ba...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 161 describes how node bandwidth ratios are
 computed and how they can be produced in parallel.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-computing-bandwidth-adjustments.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-computing-bandwidth-adjustments.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-co...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 162 describes &quot;consensus flavors&quot;: the size of the networkstatus
consensus is critical, since every user fetches it every few hours. So
we need a way to add new fields -- and remove old fields -- in a way
that lets old clients continue to use the consensus. The current plan
is to build and distribute several different versions at once, so each
client can fetch the one with the format they expect.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/162-consensus-flavors.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/162-consensus-flavors.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/162-co...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 163 starts to consider the problem of clients using relays as
single-hop proxies. If many clients start doing this (say, to improve
their own performance), it puts additional risk on the relays, since now
an attacker can expect to discover both client origins and destinations
by attacking the relay. Our current strategy for forcing clients to use
more than one hop is quite fragile, and it looks like we will soon need
more robust strategies.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/163-detecting-clients.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/163-detecting-clients.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/163-de...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 164 suggests ways to make it easier for relay operators to
discover why they are not listed in the networkstatus consensus. We have
a handle of people each week ask us on IRC why their relay isn&#39;t listed,
and currently the only way to answer is to have a competent directory
authority operator go dig around in various files in his datadirectory.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/164-reporting-server-status.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/164-reporting-server-status.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/164-re...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 165 focuses on simplifying the steps required to add a new
directory authority. The current approach requires manual work from every
directory authority operator within a space of several hours. As the
number of authorities grows, this synchronization is becoming impractical
-- and that&#39;s causing us to leave the number of authorities small, which
makes us vulnerable to other attacks. Once this proposal is finalized
and deployed, we&#39;ll hopefully be able to add new authorities more
smoothly.
 <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/165-simple-robust-voting.txt" title="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/165-simple-robust-voting.txt">https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/165-si...</a></p>

<p><strong>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.</strong>
Jacob attended CONFidence in Krakow, Poland as a keynote speaker. <a href="http://2009.confidence.org.pl/" title="http://2009.confidence.org.pl/">http://2009.confidence.org.pl/</a></p>

<p>Andrew and Jacob attended the Soul of a New Machine conference in Berkeley, CA. <a href="http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/" title="http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/">http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/</a></p>

<p>Roger and Andrew attended the 7th Annual Chinese Internet Research Conference in Philadelphia, PA. <a href="http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/index.php?page=167" title="http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/index.php?page=167">http://www.global.asc.upenn.edu/index.php?page=167</a></p>

<p>Karsten attended SIGINT 09 in Cologne.</p>

<p>Mike gave a presentation on TorFlow at CodeCon.</p>

<p>Roger met with Nick, Paul Syverson and Aaron Johnson at Yale to work more on Paul&#39;s research question: if we trust some Tor relays differently than others, how should we select our paths to be safe, and how do we analyze how safe the paths are?</p>

<p>Roger did a talk for about 15 OSI people in Budapest, Hungary.</p>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD</strong>
The two large changes were the ability to run multiple instances of Firefox at once, such that a user&#39;s personal firefox shouldn&#39;t share data with the firefox from our bundle. The other change is the ability to stop TBB firefox from scanning the system for potential plugins, like Windows Media, Java, etc.</p>

<p>Started work on a hardened branch of Incognito live CD to help protect users from possible bugs in the programs running.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<p>We documented the metrics we collect to help us determine the best ways to scale the Tor network. <a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/performance-measurements-and-blockingresistance-analysis-tor-network" title="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/performance-measurements-and-blockingresistance-analysis-tor-network">http://blog.torproject.org/blog/performance-measurements-and-blockingres...</a> A number of nodes are now collecting this information to assist our network-wide measurements.</p>

<p>Much progress on torctl and torflow tools being used to measure real and potential performance of nodes in the public tor network.</p>

<p>Mike wrote proposal 161 describing how node bandwidth ratios are
 computed and how they can be produced in parallel. The proposal can be found at <a href="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-computing-bandwidth-adjustments.txt" title="http://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-computing-bandwidth-adjustments.txt">http://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-com...</a></p>

<p>Karsten finished a first patch to dump statistics about local queues to disk every 15 minutes. A first impression of how these data could be evaluated can be found in <a href="http://freehaven.net/%7Ekarsten/volatile/bufferstats-2009-05-25.pdf" title="http://freehaven.net/~karsten/volatile/bufferstats-2009-05-25.pdf">http://freehaven.net/~karsten/volatile/bufferstats-2009-05-25.pdf</a>. The goal is to see if our buffer allocation algorithms are sufficient or need tweaking.</p>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong>
Developed the ability to split Apple OS X bundles into 1.44MB chunks. The functionality is native to OS X versions 10.4 and newer. It will not work in versions 10.3.9 or earlier releases.</p>

<p><strong>Translation work, ultimately a browser-based approach</strong>
11 Polish updates
4 German updates

          <p>A company in China has produced its own distribution of linux, called <a href="http://www.redflag-linux.com/">Red Flag Linux</a>. Various reports are that Internet cafes are <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/microsoft%20to%20linux-12022008144416.html">being forced to install it</a>. We have no confirmed reports of this actually occurring. However, a few users have asked for rpms anyway.</p>

<p>If you happen to run this Red Flag distribution, we have some test rpms based on tor 0.2.1.15-rc for you.</p>

          <p>Tor 0.2.1.15-rc marks the second release candidate for the 0.2.1.x
series. It fixes a major bug on fast exit relays, as well as a variety
of more minor bugs.</p>

<p>This is a release candidate! That means that we don&#39;t know of any
remaining show-stopping bugs, and this will become the new stable if
there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems
that you find.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.15-rc - 2009-05-25</p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x):</strong> - Fix a timing-dependent, allocator-dependent, DNS-related crash bug that would occur on some exit nodes when DNS failures and timeouts occurred in certain patterns. Fix for bug 957.</p>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x):</strong> - Actually return -1 in the error case for read_bandwidth_usage().
 Harmless bug, since we currently don&#39;t care about the return value
 anywhere. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
- Provide a more useful log message if bug 977 (related to buffer
 freelists) ever reappears, and do not crash right away.
- Fix an assertion failure on 64-bit platforms when we allocated
 memory right up to the end of a memarea, then realigned the memory
 one step beyond the end. Fixes a possible cause of bug 930.
- Protect the count of open sockets with a mutex, so we can&#39;t
 corrupt it when two threads are closing or opening sockets at once.
 Fix for bug 939. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
- Don&#39;t allow a bridge to publish its router descriptor to a
 non-bridge directory authority. Fixes part of bug 932.
- When we change to or from being a bridge, reset our counts of
 client usage by country. Fixes bug 932.
- Fix a bug that made stream bandwidth get misreported to the
 controller.
- Stop using malloc_usable_size() to use more area than we had
 actually allocated: it was safe, but made valgrind really unhappy.
- Fix a memory leak when v3 directory authorities load their keys
 and cert from disk. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x):</strong> - Fix use of freed memory when deciding to mark a non-addable
 descriptor as never-downloadable. Bugfix on 0.2.1.9-alpha.</p>

          <p>This is an open call for testing of the soon to be released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.0.</p>

<p>The major changes in this version are that you can now run multiple instances of Firefox. This means each Firefox browser is independent of the others. They won&#39;t leak urls, scripts, etc between instances.</p>

<p>It also includes Tor&#39;s geoip database. This will enable people to set ExitNodes by country code. You still have to manually edit the torrc file. We&#39;d love it if someone wrote a way to do this into Vidalia (such as right click on a country in the network map and choose &quot;exit here&quot;).</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch to launching Firefox directly from Vidalia to allow multiple instances of Firefox</li>
<li>Update Firefox to 3.0.10</li>
<li>Update to Qt 4.5.1</li>
<li>Update Firefox prefs.js to stop scanning for plugins</li>
<li>Update libevent to 1.4.11</li>
<li>Include the Tor geoip database</li>
