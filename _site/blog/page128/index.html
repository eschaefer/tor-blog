	      <p>As detailed here, <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2008/msg00044.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2008/msg00044.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2008/msg00044.html</a>, there are some packaging fixes for OS X users in this 0.2.0.32 stable release.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For OS X users, there is a packaging bugfix in 0.2.0.32 labelled as
0.2.0.32a in the available packages. It turns out for years we&#39;ve been
shipping a Info.plist with an incorrect key. The issue was discovered
and reported as bug 876,
<a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details" title="https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details">https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details</a>.</p>

<p>The commit to fix the problem in the 0_2_0 branch is r17472:
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html</a></p>

<p>The commit to fix the problem in the Vidalia 0.1 branch is r3361:
<a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg/osx?order=date&amp;desc=1" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg/osx?order=date&amp;desc=1">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg...</a></p>

<p>The bug is that the OS X Installer will prompt &quot;The chosen volume
contains software which is newer then [sic] the software you are
installing.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is that the Installer looks in the file
/Library/Receipts/Vidalia.pkg/Contents/Info.plist for
CFBundleShortVersionString. We mistakenly called it
CFBundleSortVersionString, which Apple inserts &quot;1&quot; as the value. The
upgrade to Vidalia from 0.1.9 to 0.1.10 apparently triggered the issue.</p>

<p>The fix is to put the correct value in place for the future. The
simplest way to do this is to have the users click &quot;Continue&quot; when
prompted. We could have spent a lot of time trying to fix it for the
user to hide the issue, but well, that is fraught with problems and
complexities. A simple click of &quot;Continue&quot; is far simpler and less
error prone.</p>

<p>The difference between the released 0.2.0.32 Tor code is the inclusion
of r17472. It&#39;s not really 0.2.0.32a per se, but since we lack package
versions, I had to distinguish it in some way.</p>

	      <p>Tor 0.2.0.32 fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages
(and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller
security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services,
further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of
other issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html">https://www.torproject.org/download.html</a></p>

<p>Or use our new <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a> page.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.32 - 2008-11-20
Security fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;User&quot; and &quot;Group&quot; config options did not clear the
supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The &quot;User&quot; option
is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified
user&#39;s primary group. The &quot;Group&quot; option is now ignored. For more
detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL
in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum
and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848 and 857.</li>
<li>The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being
consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its
exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address
the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s
an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process
at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major bugfixes (hidden services):</p>

<ul>
<li>When fetching v0 and v2 rendezvous service descriptors in parallel,
we were failing the whole hidden service request when the v0
descriptor fetch fails, even if the v2 fetch is still pending and
might succeed. Similarly, if the last v2 fetch fails, we were
failing the whole hidden service request even if a v0 fetch is
still pending. Fixes bug 814. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>When extending a circuit to a hidden service directory to upload a
rendezvous descriptor using a BEGIN_DIR cell, almost 1/6 of all
requests failed, because the router descriptor has not been
downloaded yet. In these cases, do not attempt to upload the
rendezvous descriptor, but wait until the router descriptor is
downloaded and retry. Likewise, do not attempt to fetch a rendezvous
descriptor from a hidden service directory for which the router
descriptor has not yet been downloaded. Fixes bug 767. Bugfix
on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix several infrequent memory leaks spotted by Coverity.</li>
<li>When testing for libevent functions, set the LDFLAGS variable
correctly. Found by Riastradh.</li>
<li>Avoid a bug where the FastFirstHopPK 0 option would keep Tor from
bootstrapping with tunneled directory connections. Bugfix on
0.1.2.5-alpha. Fixes bug 797. Found by Erwin Lam.</li>
<li>When asked to connect to A.B.exit:80, if we don&#39;t know the IP for A
and we know that server B rejects most-but-not all connections to
port 80, we would previously reject the connection. Now, we assume
the user knows what they were asking for. Fixes bug 752. Bugfix
on 0.0.9rc5. Diagnosed by BarkerJr.</li>
<li>If we overrun our per-second write limits a little, count this as
having used up our write allocation for the second, and choke
outgoing directory writes. Previously, we had only counted this when
we had met our limits precisely. Fixes bug 824. Patch from by rovv.
Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Remove the old v2 directory authority &#39;lefkada&#39; from the default
list. It has been gone for many months.</li>
<li>Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on
sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fixes bug 862.</li>
<li>Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on
0.1.2.8-beta.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor bugfixes (controller):</p>

<ul>
<li>Make DNS resolved events into &quot;CLOSED&quot;, not &quot;FAILED&quot;. Bugfix on
0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves bug 807.</li>
</ul>

	      <p><strong>Design</strong>
We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website translations. We also have a second Chinese translator for the website now, so hopefully we will get more prompt translations there. Our Farsi translation from this summer is slowly becoming obsolete; we should solve that at some point.</p>

<p>We added a new &quot;30 second summary&quot; web page for Tor:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/30seconds" title="https://www.torproject.org/30seconds">https://www.torproject.org/30seconds</a>
and a new &quot;easy download&quot; page since the original is so complex:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>In the upcoming Vidalia 0.2.0 development release:
 - Support changing UI languages without having to restart Vidalia.
 - Updated Czech, Polish, Romanian and Turkish translations.</p>

<p>In the upcoming Vidalia 0.1.10 stable release:
 - Add a prettier dialog for prompting people for their control port password that also includes a checkbox for whether the user wants Vidalia to remember the entered password, a Help button, and a Reset button (Windows only).
 - Fix a crash bug that occurred when the user clicks &#39;Clear&#39; in the message log toolbar followed by &#39;Save All&#39;.
 - Uncheck the Torbutton options by default in the Windows bundle installer if Firefox is not installed.
 - Add an Windows bundle installer page that warns the user that they should install Firefox, if it looks like they haven&#39;t already done so.</p>

<p>It looks like Australia is soon to be joining the ranks of countries with a nationwide filtering regime:
 <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081016-net-filters-required-for-all-australians-no-opt-out.html" title="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081016-net-filters-required-for-all-australians-no-opt-out.html">http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081016-net-filters-required-for-a...</a></p>

<p><strong>Proposals</strong>
We finished the first iteration of our auto-updater spec:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/specs/thandy-spec.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/specs/thandy-spec.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/specs/thandy-spec.txt</a>
We detail our current auto-updater progress below.</p>

<p>Proposal 156 (Tracking blocked ports on the client side) moves us closer to having clients be able to automatically detect which ports are blocked by their local firewall, so they can bootstrap faster and avoid picking entry guards that aren&#39;t reachable for them. The the next steps here are to a) decide if this overall approach is the right approach, and b) revise the patch to be more memory-friendly.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/156-tracking-blocked-ports.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/156-tracking-blocked-ports.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/156-tracking...</a></p>

<p><strong>Advocacy</strong>
Roger started a &quot;Brainstorming about Tor, Germany, and data retention&quot; thread on or-dev:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Oct-2008/msg00001.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Oct-2008/msg00001.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Oct-2008/msg00001.html</a>
which eventually turned into a blog post:
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor%2C-germany%2C-and-data-retention" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor%2C-germany%2C-and-data-retention">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor%2C-germany%2C-and-data-retention</a>
as well as a (rejected) 25C3 submission. While I had originally been thinking of the issue in terms of what the ISP of a Tor relay might do, the discussion also came up about what responsibilities a Tor relay operator has with respect to the vague new data retention laws:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/threads.html#00126" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/threads.html#00126">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/threads.html#00126</a>
The ultimate result was a clarified perspective on logging inside Tor:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00274.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00274.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00274.html</a></p>

<p>We finally tracked down and solved the mysterious DoS attacks on some of the Tor directory authorities:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00056.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00056.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2008/msg00056.html</a></p>

<p>We started chatting with Aaron about his &quot;tor2web&quot; proxy idea for letting non-Tor users access hidden service content:
 <a href="http://tor.theinfo.org/" title="http://tor.theinfo.org/">http://tor.theinfo.org/</a>
Somebody should follow up on that more to encourage him to keep at it.</p>

<p>Announced Joel Reardon&#39;s thesis on or-talk, and followed up with him to point him to some pieces of anonbib he needs to read more, to tell him about 25C3, and to remind him to publish his new measurement tools lest they become lost to time.</p>

<p>Roger and Karsten got the patches from proposal 155 into svn, and ultimately into the upcoming 0.2.1.7-alpha release. These were the bulk of the October progress for that NLnet project:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/hidserv.html.en#Oct08" title="https://www.torproject.org/projects/hidserv.html.en#Oct08">https://www.torproject.org/projects/hidserv.html.en#Oct08</a></p>

<p>Mike deleted the router-stability file for his directory authority (ides), which should provide temporary relief from bug 696 (which was causing most of the Stable flags to be assigned wrong, and in turn was causing instant messaging and related connections over Tor to be way more flaky than they should be):
 <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?do=details&amp;id=696" title="https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?do=details&amp;id=696">https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?do=details&amp;id=696</a>
If his router-stability file gets corrupted again, we will have learned something.</p>

<p>Roger, Jacob, and Mike went to the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit on Oct 24-26 in Mountain View, where we met with a few hundred other GSoC mentors and generally shared information about Tor and how to make good use of summer students working on free software tools.</p>

<p>We also went to dinner with Niels Provos while we were there, to talk about options for the &quot;Google gives you a captcha if you&#39;re using Tor&quot; problem. It looks like the right answer there will be for Torbutton to automate some workaround.</p>

<p>Andrew started working with Jillian York, so she can start blogging about the great uses of Tor. More news in November, e.g.
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knight-pulse%2C-jillian%2C-and-tor" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knight-pulse%2C-jillian%2C-and-tor">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knight-pulse%2C-jillian%2C-and-tor</a></p>

<p>Matt Edman printed Vidalia T-shirts, and sent them out to the folks who have helped work on Vidalia lately. He is also working with a volunteer to clean up the Vidalia website, make new logos, clean up the installer graphics, etc.</p>

<p>Andrew wrote a blog post about anonymity in South Korea:
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/online-anonymity-debate-south-korea" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/online-anonymity-debate-south-korea">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/online-anonymity-debate-south-korea</a></p>

<p><strong>Distribution</strong>
Work on the Tor VM project continues. We have a working prototype available now with a walk-through and screenshots:

<p>We plan to release a more public alpha installer in November.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability</strong>
From the Tor 0.2.1.7-alpha ChangeLog:
&quot;The &quot;ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses&quot; config option wasn&#39;t being consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its exit policy doesn&#39;t allow it, we would remember what IP address the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it&#39;s an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong>
We changed our auto update design from code-name Glider to code-name Thandy, since there&#39;s a World of Warcraft cheat program named Glider and it might be a problem for WoW players that try to use Tor.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got the PKI and server-side for the auto updater in place. We wrote up a howto walking through how to set up the server-side for the updater, including how to assign roles and generate keys:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/HOWTO" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/HOWTO">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/updater/trunk/doc/HOWTO</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve also decided that Python should work fine for the client-side too. Mike found some techniques to include only exactly the python libs we need, rather than the whole mess of python libs:
 <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/BetterCompression" title="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/BetterCompression">http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/BetterCompression</a>
and Martin has been messing with saving some additional space by sharing the openssl lib between Tor and Thandy.</p>

<p>The next steps for November are:
 - Roger is going to figure out what PKI we want for the first round of testing (what roles, which keys, how many, who, etc), and deploy a Thandy server so we can put some basic packages on it for testing.
 - Nick is going to finish the client-side of Thandy, in terms of teaching it how to decide which packages and bundles are out of date, and teaching it to download new files and check all the right signatures.
 - Martin is going to package Thandy plus all the right python libs in an easy Windows exe that hopefully isn&#39;t too big.
 - Matt Edman is going to add a simple interface to Vidalia for client-side Thandy configuration: stuff like a GUI for telling the user that new updates have appeared and letting the user click &quot;yes, please update me now&quot;, etc.
 - Nick and Matt are going to brainstorm more about the interface between Vidalia and Thandy. For example, which program should keep state about the versions of each package that are installed, which program should be responsible for noticing if an install or upgrade attempt fails, etc.</p>

<p>All the steps but the last I think are going to be pretty straightforward. This last step has the most potential pitfalls in it, since we&#39;re trying to keep Thandy general and platform-independent yet *something* (either Thandy or Vidalia, or something in between) has to tackle all the crazy Windows-specific pieces.</p>

<p>It also looks like we should move the Tor packages and bundles from NSIS (Nullsoft installer) to MSI installer, as MSI can handle versioning and automatic installs (and uninstalls!) more gracefully. It&#39;s not yet clear yet if we&#39;re going to try to squeeze that installer shift into the November development timeframe.</p>

<p><strong>Tor Browser Bundle</strong>
We&#39;ve started to think about moving the Tor Browser Bundle from Firefox 2 to Firefox 3. This will mean we should measure new traces. We&#39;ll do it once Torbutton is known to be more stable on Firefox 3, which should happen in early 2009.</p>

	      <p>We&#39;re excited to be doing a set of posts over at <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org">KnightPulse</a> about anonymity and how it can help foster citizen journalism. In order to provide more professional content and topics, we&#39;re working with <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/">Jillian C. York</a> as our lead author for the series.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/08/11/24/why-browse-internet-anonymously">video interview and full post</a> are available. Expect a series of these over the next few months. Feel free to suggest relevant topics or people willing to be interviewed, anonymously or not, about their experiences with Tor and citizen journalism. Bonus points if you want to do a video interview.</p>

<p>This is also our first experience doing a video interview over Skype. Skype repeatedly cut out and lost all connections to its servers a few times. The video is edited to piece it back together. Not sure if it&#39;s just Skype for Linux that has these issues.</p>

<p>All in all, a great experience and looking forward to working with Knight Pulse and Jillian.</p>
