          <p><p>Tor 0.2.1.17-rc marks the fourth -- and hopefully last -- release
candidate for the 0.2.1.x series. It lays the groundwork for further
client performance improvements, and also fixes a big bug with directory
authorities that were causing them to assign Guard and Stable flags
poorly.</p>

<p>The Windows bundles also finally include the geoip database that we
thought we&#39;d been shipping since 0.2.0.x (oops), and the OS X bundles
should actually install Torbutton rather than giving you a cryptic
failure message (oops).</p>

<p>This is a release candidate! That means that we don&#39;t know of any
remaining show-stopping bugs, and 0.2.1.18 will be the new stable if
there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems
that you find.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.17-rc - 2009-07-02
<strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clients now use the bandwidth values in the consensus, rather than
the bandwidth values in each relay descriptor. This approach opens
the door to more accurate bandwidth estimates once the directory
authorities start doing active measurements. Implements more of
proposal 141.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When Tor clients restart after 1-5 days, they discard all their
cached descriptors as too old, but they still use the cached
consensus document. This approach is good for robustness, but
bad for performance: since they don&#39;t know any bandwidths, they
end up choosing at random rather than weighting their choice by
speed. Fixed by the above feature of putting bandwidths in the
consensus. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Directory authorities were neglecting to mark relays down in their
internal histories if the relays fall off the routerlist without
ever being found unreachable. So there were relays in the histories
that haven&#39;t been seen for eight months, and are listed as being
up for eight months. This wreaked havoc on the &quot;median wfu&quot;
and &quot;median mtbf&quot; calculations, in turn making Guard and Stable
flags very wrong, hurting network performance. Fixes bugs 696 and

<ol>
<li>Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Serve the DirPortFrontPage page even when we have been approaching
our quotas recently. Fixes bug 1013; bugfix on 0.2.1.8-alpha.</li>
<li>The control port would close the connection before flushing long
replies, such as the network consensus, if a QUIT command was issued
before the reply had completed. Now, the control port flushes all
pending replies before closing the connection. Also fixed a spurious
warning when a QUIT command is issued after a malformed or rejected
AUTHENTICATE command, but before the connection was closed. Patch
by Marcus Griep. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x; fixes bugs 1015 and 1016.</li>
<li>When we can&#39;t find an intro key for a v2 hidden service descriptor,
fall back to the v0 hidden service descriptor and log a bug message.
Workaround for bug 1024.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we&#39;re a relay and we change our IP address, be more verbose
about the reason that made us change. Should help track down
further bugs for relays on dynamic IP addresses.</li>
</ul>

          <p><p><strong>New releases</strong></p>

<p>On June 20th we released Tor 0.2.1.16-rc.
On June 21st, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.1.
On June 23rd, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.2.
On June 24th, we released Tor 0.2.0.35-stable. We expect that this release is the last of the 0.2.0.x -stable series, soon to be replaced with the 0.2.1.x series.
On June 30th, we released Vidalia 0.1.14.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship circumvention</strong></p>

<p>Packaged rpms for Red Flag Linux version 6. Red Flag Linux is reported to be the new operating system for all Internet cafe&#39;s in China. So far, no one has seen this conversion actually happen, but now we&#39;re ready if it does.</p>

<p>Our email autoresponder, gettor , received a number of patches to deal with dkim issues, including finding a dkim bug that prevented yahoo email users from fetching Tor. This bug has been fixed. Additionally, we&#39;ve whitelisted some domains where we
see we&#39;re having lots of use but dkim isn&#39;t always configured properly. We&#39;ve had thousands of users from China using gettor.</p>

<p><strong>Outreach/Advocacy</strong></p>

<p>Andrew, Roger, and Wendy attended Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 2009 Conference ( <a href="http://www.cfp2009.org" title="http://www.cfp2009.org">http://www.cfp2009.org</a>). Andrew presented a “quicktake” talk on “Who uses Tor?”. Andrew and Roger, along with Paul Syverson, and a North African blogger, hosted a panel on “It Takes A Village To Be Anonymous”. Due to the sensitive situation surrounding the blogger, this panel was not recorded.</p>

<p>Andrew talked with the Committee to Protect Journalists ( <a href="http://cpj.org" title="http://cpj.org">http://cpj.org</a>) about online security and circumvention tools.</p>

<p>Jillian C. York blogged at KnightPulse about “Average citizens browse anonymously
”, <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymously" title="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymously">http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/06/04/average-citizens-browse-anonymo...</a></p>

<p>Due to Iranian&#39;s usage of Tor during the recent election, the general press/media conducted a few interviews with Andrew:</p>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong></p>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 released in June. Planning a migration of the base operating system for the Incognito LiveCD to switch from Gentoo to an Ubuntu variant. We can always use help in maintaining Incognito.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<p>June was spent documenting, stabilizing, and streamlining the bandwidth authority scanner, which has been runningfor a while on the Directory Authority named ides.</p>

<p>It is good enough to start running on multiple authorities now to produce actual results for clients to use.</p>

<p><strong>More reliable (e.g. split) download mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>Our email autoresponder, gettor , received a number of patches to deal with dkim issues, including finding a dkim bug that prevented yahoo email users from fetching Tor. This bug
has been fixed. Additionally, we&#39;ve whitelisted some domains where we see we&#39;re having lots of use but dkim isn&#39;t always configured properly. We&#39;ve had thousands of users from China using gettor.</p>

<p>The Tor Check website (check.torproject.org) had a few bugs and we&#39;ve fixed all but two. We sometimes still have false negatives (because the Tor client doesn&#39;t know to fetch the consensus at any specific time) and we also still sometimes barf python exceptions because mod_python has some weird exception from time to time. We also accepted a patch from Marcus Greip that extends the TorBulkExitList to allow arbitrary ports rather than just port 80.</p>

<p><strong>Footprints from Tor Browser Bundle.</strong></p>

<p>Reduced the scanning for plugins Portable Firefox can do on launch of the application. There is still an issue where Firefox displays other plugins to users, but they aren&#39;t actually valid plugins and won&#39;t run on command. Firefox acquires the names through queries to the Windows Registry.</p>

          <p><p>I&#39;m researching where to host one or two Directory Authorities outside
the US and EU.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been suggested to me that Argentina, South Africa, Panama,
Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan are fine locales for a well-connected,
dedicated server. I&#39;m looking for a relatively low end dedicated server
that can transit 2-4 TB a month at relatively cheap prices (say
US$200/mo or less).</p>

<p>If you have experience and contacts at various providers, I&#39;m all ears.</p>
