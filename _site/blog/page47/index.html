        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Recently, we&#39;ve been introduced to two &quot;Tor Project&quot; Facebook Org pages. Neither of which are run by us at Tor, yet. There was also a Google+ page for a while, too. We currently use a few social media methods, such as <a href="https://lists.torproject.org">mailing lists</a>, pgp web of trust, <a href="ircs://irc.torproject.org/#tor">internet relay chat</a>, <a href="https://identi.ca/torproject">Identi.ca</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/torproject">Twitter</a>. Some people are very upset Tor is seemingly supporting Facebook, Google+ and others.</p>

<p>We&#39;re expanding into Facebook, Google+, Reddit, and others because our users are asking for it. There are existing Tor communities in many places, and we don&#39;t need to formally be at them all. It&#39;s great when individuals step up to the challenge and represent Tor in positive ways. However, as people join these communities, they are looking for a real discussion with us. For many people, these platforms are the primary means of communication.</p>

<p>We do have some concerns about social media sites. Let&#39;s enumerate these concerns.</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>Current social media solutions don&#39;t respect user privacy, however it&#39;s all we have today. With buttons like &quot;+1&quot;, &quot;Like&quot;, and &quot;Tweet this&quot; strewn about websites, tracking your normal web activity, Tor is at least one solution to help you stop this global tracking. We believe you should be fully in control of your own data and metadata.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>The users are currently using these systems in very unsafe ways. We can join the system and set up a presence with details about how to use these systems more safely--or if they cannot be used safely at all. The goal is to educate people.The EFF has an <a href="https://www.eff.org/free-speech-weak-link#platforms">explanation</a> of these risks as well.</p>

<p>3.</p>

<p>We can get our message out to people and have a discussion with them, where they are, even though we don&#39;t control the medium and risk getting kicked off the system.</p>

<p>4.</p>

<p>Some are impersonating us now, and not at the quality level we want to see. A bad answer or impression from a fake Tor is worse than no answer at all.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we write our own?</p>

<p>Writing and deploying our own social media system is beyond the scope of our mission. However, tor can provide an anonymous base for such a system. We have hope for systems like <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a>, <a href="http://tent.io">tent</a>, and <a href="https://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/">FreedomBox</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://cloud.torproject.org/">The Tor Cloud</a> images for all the seven regions have been updated to include the latest cloud image for stable Ubuntu release 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx). These new images are available on the Tor Cloud website.</p>

<p>The new images include a fix to allow Tor to upgrade automatically without requiring user intervention ( <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6511">#6511</a>).</p>

<p>If you are already running a Tor Cloud bridge, you will need to either manually update your image, or set up a new Tor Cloud bridge and terminate the old one. If you decide not to take action, your image will fail to upgrade Tor correctly and will not be running as a bridge.</p>

<p>To manually update your image, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log on with SSH</li>
<li>Open /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</li>
<li>Add the line: Dpkg::Options { --force-confold; }</li>
<li>Save and exit</li>

          <p>Your job would be to work on Torbutton and patches to our Firefox-based browser, as well as a potential Android port. This would be a contractor position likely starting in October and going through Q1 2013, with the possibility of later in 2013 and beyond. There may also be a possibility for part-time work prior to October.</p>

<p>The purpose of our browser is to build a private-by-design reference implementation of &quot;Do Not Track&quot;, but through the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">alteration of browser behavior</a> and without the need for <a href="br%20/%3E%0Ahttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-private-browsing-modes-do-not-track-vs-real-privacy-design">regulation or begging</a>.</p>

<p>Your job will include triaging, diagnosing, and fixing bugs; looking for and resolving web privacy issues; responding on short notice to security issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on implementing new features and web behavior changes.</p>

<p>We&#39;d also need help making our code more maintainable, testable, and mergeable by upstream. Sometimes, we need to drop everything and scramble to implement last-minute fixes, or to deploy urgent security updates. You&#39;d also be reviewing other people&#39;s code, designs, and academic research papers, and looking for ways to improve upon them.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en">job posting</a> for information on how to apply and what you need to send in with your application.</p>

<p>For an even more detailed overview of the full breadth and depth of the work you&#39;d be doing, have a look at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/">The Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser</a>, especially <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#DesignRequirements">The Design Requirements</a> section.</p>
