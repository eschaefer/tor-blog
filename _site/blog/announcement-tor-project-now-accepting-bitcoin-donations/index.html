            <h2>Announcement: The Tor Project is now accepting Bitcoin Donations</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Over the past year, we have received many requests for us to accept bitcoin donations. After careful consideration and research, we are thrilled to announce that effective today The Tor Project is accepting bitcoin donations. In partnership with <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a>, bitcoins can easily and directly be donated to support Torâ€™s ongoing mission of being the global resource for privacy technology advocacy, research and education in the ongoing pursuit of freedom of speech, privacy rights online, and censorship circumvention. Check out our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate#bitcoin">donations page</a> now. Bitcoin donations received by The Tor Project will be converted directly to US Dollars.</p>

<p>Our decision to accept bitcoins has been well thought out and researched from a financial accounting perspective with an eye on passing our required annual A-133 audit. We believe we are the <em>first</em> US 501(c)3 non-profit organization to test acceptance of bitcoins and attempt to pass the US Government A-133 Audit Standard. Our 2013 audit results, along with our past <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en">financial documents</a>, will be made available on our website once complete in 2014.</p>

<p>The Tor Project is also proud to be in the company of other visible non-profit organizations accepting bitcoins including <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/eff-will-accept-bitcoins-support-digital-liberty">EFF</a> and <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>Why is this important? The Tor Project needs your donations to continue our mission and to keep the Tor suite of technologies ahead with the growing threats to privacy and anonymity around the world. Your donation made TODAY, through bitcoin, Paypal, Amazon Payments, Givv.org, checks, money orders or bank transfers, will provide greater security and privacy for millions around the world who use Tor every day.</p>

<p>Help us continue our mission!</p>
