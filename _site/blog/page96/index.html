          <p>Tor 0.2.2.14-alpha greatly improves client-side handling of circuit build
timeouts, which are used to estimate speed and improve performance. We
also move to a much better GeoIP database, port Tor to Windows CE,
introduce new compile flags that improve code security, add an eighth
v3 directory authority, and address a lot of more minor issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Packages will be appearing over the next few days or weeks. (We&#39;ve decided
to start announcing alpha versions when they&#39;re released, rather than
waiting for all the packages first.)</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.14-alpha - 2010-07-12
 o Major bugfixes:
 - Tor directory authorities no longer crash when started with a
 cached-microdesc-consensus file in their data directory. Bugfix
 on 0.2.2.6-alpha; fixes bug 1532.
 - Treat an unset $HOME like an empty $HOME rather than triggering an
 assert. Bugfix on 0.0.8pre1; fixes bug 1522.
 - Ignore negative and large circuit build timeout values that can
 happen during a suspend or hibernate. These values caused various
 asserts to fire. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes bug 1245.
 - Alter calculation of Pareto distribution parameter &#39;Xm&#39; for
 Circuit Build Timeout learning to use the weighted average of the
 top N=3 modes (because we have three entry guards). Considering
 multiple modes should improve the timeout calculation in some cases,
 and prevent extremely high timeout values. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha;
 fixes bug 1335.
 - Alter calculation of Pareto distribution parameter &#39;Alpha&#39; to use a
 right censored distribution model. This approach improves over the
 synthetic timeout generation approach that was producing insanely
 high timeout values. Now we calculate build timeouts using truncated
 times. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes bugs 1245 and 1335.
 - Do not close circuits that are under construction when they reach
 the circuit build timeout. Instead, leave them building (but do not
 use them) for up until the time corresponding to the 95th percentile
 on the Pareto CDF or 60 seconds, whichever is greater. This is done
 to provide better data for the new Pareto model. This percentile
 can be controlled by the consensus.</p>

<p>o Major features:
 - Move to the June 2010 Maxmind GeoLite country db (rather than the
 June 2009 ip-to-country GeoIP db) for our statistics that count
 how many users relays are seeing from each country. Now we have
 more accurate data for many African countries.
 - Port Tor to build and run correctly on Windows CE systems, using
 the wcecompat library. Contributed by Valerio Lupi.
 - New &quot;--enable-gcc-hardening&quot; ./configure flag (off by default)
 to turn on gcc compile time hardening options. It ensures
 that signed ints have defined behavior (-fwrapv), enables
 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (requiring -O2), adds stack smashing protection
 with canaries (-fstack-protector-all), turns on ASLR protection if
 supported by the kernel (-fPIE, -pie), and adds additional security
 related warnings. Verified to work on Mac OS X and Debian Lenny.
 - New &quot;--enable-linker-hardening&quot; ./configure flag (off by default)
 to turn on ELF specific hardening features (relro, now). This does
 not work with Mac OS X or any other non-ELF binary format.</p>

<p>o New directory authorities:
 - Set up maatuska (run by Linus Nordberg) as the eighth v3 directory
 authority.</p>

<p>o Minor features:
 - New config option &quot;WarnUnsafeSocks 0&quot; disables the warning that
 occurs whenever Tor receives only an IP address instead of a
 hostname. Setups that do DNS locally over Tor are fine, and we
 shouldn&#39;t spam the logs in that case.
 - Convert the HACKING file to asciidoc, and add a few new sections
 to it, explaining how we use Git, how we make changelogs, and
 what should go in a patch.
 - Add a TIMEOUT_RATE keyword to the BUILDTIMEOUT_SET control port
 event, to give information on the current rate of circuit timeouts
 over our stored history.
 - Add ability to disable circuit build time learning via consensus
 parameter and via a LearnCircuitBuildTimeout config option. Also
 automatically disable circuit build time calculation if we are
 either a AuthoritativeDirectory, or if we fail to write our state
 file. Fixes bug 1296.
 - More gracefully handle corrupt state files, removing asserts
 in favor of saving a backup and resetting state.
 - Rename the &quot;log.h&quot; header to &quot;torlog.h&quot; so as to conflict with fewer
 system headers.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:
 - Build correctly on OSX with zlib 1.2.4 and higher with all warnings
 enabled.
 - When a2x fails, mention that the user could disable manpages instead
 of trying to fix their asciidoc installation.
 - Where available, use Libevent 2.0&#39;s periodic timers so that our
 once-per-second cleanup code gets called even more closely to
 once per second than it would otherwise. Fixes bug 943.
 - If you run a bridge that listens on multiple IP addresses, and
 some user configures a bridge address that uses a different IP
 address than your bridge writes in its router descriptor, and the
 user doesn&#39;t specify an identity key, their Tor would discard the
 descriptor because &quot;it isn&#39;t one of our configured bridges&quot;, and
 fail to bootstrap. Now believe the descriptor and bootstrap anyway.
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
 - If OpenSSL fails to make a duplicate of a private or public key, log
 an error message and try to exit cleanly. May help with debugging
 if bug 1209 ever remanifests.
 - Save a couple bytes in memory allocation every time we escape
 certain characters in a string. Patch from Florian Zumbiehl.
 - Make it explicit that we don&#39;t cannibalize one-hop circuits. This
 happens in the wild, but doesn&#39;t turn out to be a problem because
 we fortunately don&#39;t use those circuits. Many thanks to outofwords
 for the initial analysis and to swissknife who confirmed that
 two-hop circuits are actually created.
 - Make directory mirrors report non-zero dirreq-v[23]-shares again.
 Fixes bug 1564; bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha.
 - Eliminate a case where a circuit build time warning was displayed
 after network connectivity resumed. Bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

          <p><strong>New releases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On June 1, we released the latest Tor Browser Bundle for Linux, version 1.0.7. This is a compatibility release to allow the bundle to work on a wider variety of Linux distributions.</li>
<li>On June 2, updated the Vidalia bundle for OS X PowerPC to include Vidalia 0.2.9.</li>
<li>On June 14, we released orbot 0.0.8. This is a maintenance release to ﬁx issues discovered with Android 2.2.</li>
<li>On June 17, Tor and the EFF released a Firefox extension called HTTPS Everywhere. The goal is to enable encrypted website viewing by default. More about this release at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/https-everywhere-firefox-addon-helps-you-encrypt-web-traffic" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/https-everywhere-firefox-addon-helps-you-encrypt-web-traffic">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/https-everywhere-firefox-addon-helps-yo...</a>.</li>
<li>Damian continues to improve and release new versions of ARM, the console-based anonymizing relay monitor, <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/" title="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">http://www.atagar.com/arm/</a>. Consider it to be like the graphical control application, Vidalia, for relays without a graphical environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We updated the geoip mapping database to the Maxmind GeoLite Country database in tor after an analysis of various geoip mapping databases. The Maxmind GeoLite Country database has more accurate mappings for many parts of the world, such as Iran, SouthEast Asia, and many African countries.</li>
<li>China’s Great Firewall continues blocking connections to the public Tor relays. They also updated their blocking to include bridge relays published via email and https websites. We conducted further research into the blocking mechanisms from inside China. A detailed analysis shows China GFW is blocking 90% of the published bridges in the https and smtp pools. The blocking is simply IP Address and TCP port combinations. Bridge relays that have been seeded into various social networks in China as well as new bridge addresses continue to work well.</li>
<li>In late June, we started receiving many reports that Nigerian internet providers are blocking many circumvention tools, Tor included. Data about the blocking methods implemented are sparse right now, but we’re continuing to work with a few smart Nigerians to reverse-engineer the blocking regime. More details about this block at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/dear-nigerians-help-us-help-you" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/dear-nigerians-help-us-help-you">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/dear-nigerians-help-us-help-you</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Measures of the Tor Network</strong>
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/exit-2010-06.png" title="https://blog.torproject.org/files/exit-2010-06.png">https://blog.torproject.org/files/exit-2010-06.png</a>
This graph shows the total quantity of relays and quantity of exit relays in june 2010. Exit relay capacity is one of the potential bottlenecks that aﬀects the overall performance of Tor. The more exit relays we have, the faster it seems to browse the open Internet. As seen in late June, a researcher using PlanetLab hooked up 512 relays to the Tor network for their research into cloud computing and scaling eﬀects on the Tor Network. Before contacting PlanetLab, we removed all 512 nodes from the network consensus so users couldn’t use the suspect relays. We contacted the researcher and the relays were subsequently disabled.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/networksize-2010-06.png" title="https://blog.torproject.org/files/networksize-2010-06.png">https://blog.torproject.org/files/networksize-2010-06.png</a>
This graph shows the total quantity of relays and the total quantity of bridges in June 2010. The quantity of bridges is stable throughout the month. As seen in late June, a researcher using PlanetLab hooked up 512 relays to the Tor network for their research into cloud computing and scaling eﬀects on the Tor Network. Before contacting PlanetLab, we removed all 512 nodes from the network consensus so users couldn’t use the suspect relays. We contacted the researcher and the relays were subsequently disabled.</p>

This graphs shows how many seconds it took to complete a 50KB download from a standard Tor client. This measurement is from the server torperf, located in Chicago, Illinois. As you can see, latency dropped dramatically over the month for the second month in a row. We believe this is due to the ﬁxes for relays in 0.2.1.26 allow relays to handle older clients ﬂooding circuit requests to relays. As some relays were overloaded and dropped out of the network, the remaining relays had to handle an increasing load of users. Also, we have a budding competition between individuals looking to run the highest bandwidth relays. TorServersdotNet, <a href="http://www.torservers.net/" title="http://www.torservers.net/">http://www.torservers.net/</a>, starting running some very high bandwidth relays to increase performance and provide a way for non-technical users to support tor through combined ﬁnancial donations in exchange for Tor servers. We’re also looking to run this measurement software on a linux client connected to a standard dial-up modem to see how Tor fares in extremely low-bandwidth environments.</p>

<p><strong>Outreach and Advocacy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Andrew met with the Wesleyan University Humantarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) team working on Tor for their summer project. They are ﬁxing up the Tor Weather application to allow for more features as requested by relay operators and attempting a start a Tor Status re-write, design, and update. <a href="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/" title="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/">http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/</a>.</li>
<li>Jacob attended FooCamp 2010.</li>
<li>Mike, along with Peter Eckersley from EFF, met with the Mozilla team to talk about web ﬁngerprinting, privacy, and Torbutton. Mike’s summary of their discussion is at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-private-browsing-mode-torbutton-and-fingerprinting" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-private-browsing-mode-torbutton-and-fingerprinting">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/firefox-private-browsing-mode-torbutton...</a>.</li>
<li>Sebastian and Linus gave a Tor talk to the Netherlands Privacy group, PvIB ( <a href="https://www.pvib.nl/home" title="https://www.pvib.nl/home">https://www.pvib.nl/home</a>). Their presentation is at <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/pvib-2.pdf" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/pvib-2.pdf">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/pvib-2.pdf</a>.</li>
<li>Runa gave a Tor talk to Electronic Frontier Norway, <a href="http://www.efn.no/" title="http://www.efn.no/">http://www.efn.no/</a>.</li>
<li>We added an eigth directory authority called “maatuska“ hosted in Sweden.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preconﬁgured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong>
Erinn continues to work on a Tor Browser Bundle for Apple’s OS X. Erinn continues to improve Tor Browser Bundle for Linux with feedback from initial users and other volunteer developers.</p>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong>
Andrew published a template conﬁguration ﬁle for tor relays to be a bridge automatically. It seems some relay operators are confused as to conﬁguring their relay as a bridge. The conﬁguration template is at <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/src/config/torrc.bridge.in" title="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob\_plain/HEAD:/src/config/torrc.bridge.in">https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/src/config/torrc....</a> and will be included in future Tor releases.</p>

<p>Andrew created some experimental “bridge by default“ bundles for Microsoft Windows. The idea is to use existing technology and see if we can get users to be bridges by default without any additional conﬁguration. Intitial testing shows it works well if the upstream router or NAT device has Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) enabled. The largest obstacle is still the manual conﬁguration of ﬁrewalls, routers, and NAT devices if UPNP is not enabled by default. More details about this experiment are at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/technology-preview-bridge-default-microsoft-windows-clients" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/technology-preview-bridge-default-microsoft-windows-clients">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/technology-preview-bridge-default-micro...</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, eﬃciency.</strong>
Mike spent a lot of eﬀort and research into optimizing the circuit based timing (CBT) codebase. CBT is how clients measure the performance of their tor circuits to better optimize performance.
The changelog of the ﬁxes is:
• Major bugﬁxes:
– Ignore negative and large timeout values that can happen during a suspend or hibernate. These values caused various asserts to ﬁre in the circuit build times code, crashing Tor. Bug 1245, bugﬁx on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
– Alter calculation of Pareto distribution parameter ’Xm’ for Circuit Build Timeout learning to use the weighted average of the top N=3 modes. This should improve the timeout calculation in some cases, and prevent extremely high timeout values. Bug 1335, bugﬁx on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
– Implement a ﬁltering step to recompute synthetic build times every time the timeoutchanges. Additionally, place a lower cap on synthetic build times, and allow this cap tobe controlled by the consensus. This should also improve the build time calculations,and should eliminate a case where Tor was allocating an excessive amount of temporary memory during timeout calculation. Bugs 1335 and 1245, bugﬁx on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

<p>• Minor bugﬁxes:
– Eliminate a case where a circuit build time warning was displayed after network connectivity resumed.</p>

<p>• Minor features:
– Add a TIMEOUT_RATE keyword to the BUILDTIMEOUT_SET control port event, to give information on the current rate of circuit timeouts over our stored history.
– Add ability to disable circuit build time learning via consensus parameter and via a
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout conﬁg option. Also automatically disable circuit build time
calculation if we are either a AuthoritativeDirectory, or if we fail to write our state ﬁle.
Bug 1296.</p>

<p>Karsten web-enabled his ExoneraTor tool on the metrics website at <a href="http://metrics" title="http://metrics">http://metrics</a>.
torproject.org/exonerator.html. ExoneraTor tells you whether there was a Tor relay running on a given IP address at a given time. Many legal advisors, lawyers, and law enforcement ask us for data regarding if a certain IP address hosted a Tor relay at a point in time. Now this data is easily available to all.</p>

<p>Karsten ﬁxed stats on estimated user numbers after we broke the calculations of users from directory request sampling at select relays. We found that we can use entry-stats for better user number estimates.</p>

<p>Karsten compared descriptor tarballs collected by ernie with directory-archive script and found that we’re ﬁne using ernie’s data. Ernie is the code that provides the data processing and backend for the metrics.torproject.org website.</p>

<p><strong>Footprints from Tor Browser Bundle.</strong></p>

<p>Erinn continues work on footprints of the Tor Browser Bundle for Linux and Apple OS X.</p>

<p><strong>Translation work, ultimately a browser-based approach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A new translator, pierre, translated the entire website, torbutton, and gettor email autoresponder into French.</li>
<li>Added pashto (Pakistani) to the portal by request.</li>
<li>Updated translations for the website, torbutton, orbot, tor, and tor manual pages for French, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Farsi, Italian, Arabic, Dutch, Serbian, Portugese, Danish, Japanese, Polish, and Turkish.</li>

          <p><strong>Updated 06/30/2010</strong> : Mention Reduced Exit Policy, ISP Shopping Tips, and Abuse Response Templates</p>

<p><strong>Updated 08/30/2010</strong> : Update exit policy with svn, git, hg, Kerberos, remote admin panels, IRC, others</p>

<p><strong>Updated 01/12/2011</strong> : Suggest creation of LLC for large exit nodes, provide links to ARIN forms and process.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of new exit nodes have recently appeared on the network. This is great news, since exit nodes are typically on the scarce side. Exits usually occupy 30-33% of network by capacity, but are currently at a whopping 38.5% (156 MBytes/sec out of 404 total).</p>

<p>However, I want to make sure that these nodes stay up and don&#39;t end up being shut down due to easily preventable abuse complaints. I&#39;ve run a number of exit nodes on a few different ISPs and not only have I lived to tell about it, I&#39;ve have not had one shut down yet. Moreover, I&#39;ve only received about 4 abuse complaints in as many years of running exit nodes. This is in stark contrast to other node operators following a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator">more reactive strategy</a>. I&#39;m convinced this is largely because I observe the following pro-active guidelines. This guide is primarily US centric. Operators in other countries may have slightly different best practices (such as registering with RIPE and not ARIN).</p>

<p><strong>1. Inform your potential ISP(s)</strong>
In general, running an exit node from your home Internet connection is not recommended, unless you are prepared for increased attention to your home. In the USA, there have been no equipment seizures due to Tor exits, but there have been phone calls and visits. In other countries, people have had all their home computing equipment seized for running an exit from their home internet connection. So you will need to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs">find a good colo</a> and save your home connection for bridge or middle node use. Plus, bandwidth will be much cheaper in a colo center anyway.</p>

<p>Pick an ISP you can trust, and let them know exactly what is going on. A good first email is to ask them if they have an <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy">AUP</a> you can read if you can&#39;t find one online. You should also ask them if they can provide the services mentioned below in this document, such as additional IP addresses, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shared_Whois_Project">SWIP</a>, and reverse DNS, and if these services might cost extra.</p>

<p>In a follow up email, you should explain Tor to them, and why it is important to the Internet, the world, and to you, their potential customer. Giving them links to our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torusers.html.en">Tor Users</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/overview.html.en">Tor Overview</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html.en">Tor Legal FAQ</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html.en">Tor Abuse FAQ</a> is typically immensely helpful. Mentioning China and the current conflict in Iran are also likely to be helpful. If your ISP is your University, you may also want to peruse <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorGuideUniversities">this set of recommendations</a> specific to dealing with University administrators.</p>

<p>If your ISP does not approve, all is not lost: you can look into running a middle node, or a much less visible <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">bridge node</a>. It is better to learn this up front, rather than have your Internet connection shut down on you without warning. Exit bandwidth is often scarce, but any node is better than no node.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a separate IP for the node. Do not route your own traffic via this IP</strong>
While it may be tempting to mix in your traffic with your node&#39;s exit traffic for cover, this is best avoided. Having a separate IP allows your ISP to more easily recognize that abuse complaints and DMCA notices can be forwarded to you to be quickly responded to with a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorAbuseTemplates">boilerplate response</a>, as opposed to cutting off your Internet access or providing your personal information to the copyright cartels.</p>

<p><strong>3. Get recognizable Reverse DNS for this IP</strong>
Setting a good reverse DNS name for your exit IP helps to prevent knee-jerk reactions from sysadmins and DoS kiddies alike who run into bad apples coming from your node IP. Something like tor-exit.yourdomain.org or tor-proxy-readme.yourdomain.org is the best bet.</p>

<p><strong>4. Set up a Tor Exit Notice</strong>
Once you have a good reverse DNS name, you should put some content there that explains what Tor is for those who see the name and try to visit it via http. If you run your DirPort on port 80 with Tor 0.2.1.x or newer, you can use the Tor config option &quot;DirPortFrontPage&quot; to display a notice explaining that you are running an exit node. A sample one is provided in <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/contrib/operator-tools/tor-exit-notice.html">contrib/tor-exit-notice.html</a> in the source distribution. This way, when someone sees tor-proxy-readme.yourdomain.org in their logs, they hopefully will get the hint and read the notice before flaming you. Be sure to update the contact info and other places marked with FIXME in the notice.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get ARIN registration (if possible)</strong>
If you can get your ISP to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shared_Whois_Project">SWIP</a> your IP block to display a contact and abuse email that you control, this can go a long way to reducing aggravation that they may feel from dealing with the occasional abuse complaint, because the vast majority of the few complaints that are still made will go to you instead of them.</p>

<p>Having your own SWIP allocation is so important to your success that it is worth specifically offering to pay the ISP extra for it if they initially refuse. <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rwhois#RWhois">RWHOIS</a> is another possibility, but it should be considered a second choice, since most people just check the SWIP record.</p>

<p>To get a proper SWIP record, you should first <a href="https://www.arin.net/public/register_1.xhtml">create an account at ARIN</a> and create <a href="https://www.arin.net/public/secure/poc/create/begin.xhtml">POC handles</a> and the <a href="https://www.arin.net/public/secure/org/create/orgInfo.xhtml">ORG IDs</a> for yourself. You must then get your ISP to submit a <a href="https://www.arin.net/resources/request.html">resource request template</a> that references your POC handles and ORG IDs.</p>

<p>Templates at ARIN change periodically, so some ISPs may be reluctant to do the paperwork for you if it means changing their submission scripts. Again, offering to pay for this service is a good idea, if they initially stall or refuse.</p>

<p><strong>6. Consider a Reduced Exit Policy</strong>
If your node is in the USA, you should consider using a reduced exit policy. Excessive bittorrent abuse over Tor unfortunately means you will likely receive a deluge of DMCA abuse complaints. We (including the very smart lawyers at <a href="https://www.eff.org">the EFF</a>) believe Tor nodes qualify as <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi#QID564">transmission providers under DMCA 512(a)</a>, not 512(c). This makes them exempt from &quot;notice and takedown&quot; procedures, including the need to issue &quot;putback&quot; responses. The EFF has even prepared a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-dmca-response.html">template response for improper DMCA 512(c) takedown notices</a> that you can use.</p>

<p>However, your ISP may see things differently. If the abuse complaints are arriving in their staff&#39;s inbox, they may just want them to stop coming so they do not have to spend resources dealing with them, regardless of their merit. If they still won&#39;t provide SWIP registration, you can try a reduced exit policy. Other operators have had great success with <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy">using a reduced exit policy</a> consisting of ports 20-23, 43, 53, 79-81, 88, 110, 143, 194, 220, 443, 464-465, 543-544, 563, 587, 706, 749, 873, 902-904, 981, 989-995, 1194, 1220, 1293, 1500, 1723, 1863, 2082-2083, 2086-2087, 2095-2096, 3128, 3389, 3690, 4321, 4643, 5190, 5050, 5222-5223, 5900, 6666-6667, 6679, 6697, 8000, 8008, 8080, 8087-8088, 8443, 8888, 9418, 9999, 10000, and 19638. In fact, the operator of 4 of our fastest exit nodes <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jun-2010/msg00149.html">has reported</a> that after switching to this policy from the default, the bittorrent DMCA complaints ceased immediately.</p>

<p>With that list, the only abuse complaints you should see will come from occasional comment spam (ports 80 and 443), email spam to misconfigured email servers (port 465 and 587 are supposed to be for authenticated SMTP only), and misconfigured NNTP servers (port 563 is authenticated NNTPS). You may want to review <a href="http://www.wiredwings.com/wiki/Torservers.net_Main_Page#Abuse">Moritz Bartl&#39;s abuse complaint template set</a>, as well as the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorAbuseTemplates">Tor Abuse Template set</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html.en#TypicalAbuses">Tor Abuse FAQ</a> for information on how to handle these rare cases, when they do come up.</p>

<p><strong>7. Rate limit and optionally QoS your node</strong>
I&#39;ve recently conducted <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torflow-node-capacity-integrity-and-reliability-measurements-hotpets">some measurements</a> that showed that nodes that used Tor&#39;s BandwidthRate config option to set a limit slightly below their actual capacity were much more reliable than those that did not. Along these lines, it may also be useful to use this <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/contrib/linux-tor-prio.sh">Linux-based QoS script</a> to prioritize your Tor IP traffic below other traffic on your machine. Similar QoS can also be achieved via <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DDWRT</a>, <a href="http://openwrt.org/">openwrt</a> and of course via commercial routers. If you do use QoS other than that script, you should ensure that you provide Tor with a reasonable minimum bandwidth so that it does not starve when you do other things. Somewhere between 33 and 50% of your connection is a reasonable minimum value.</p>

<p><strong>8. Consider creating an LLC to run your node</strong>
If you are a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/or-talk@freehaven.net/msg14159.html">high capacity exit node operator</a>, you should consider forming an LLC or similar corporate entity for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, as a high capacity exit node, you may wish to <a href="http://www.torservers.net/donate.html">collect donations</a> from others who are unable to run exits themselves but would still like to support the effort. Creating a separate entity with a separate bank account is a really wise idea once outside money becomes involved.</p>

<p>Second, corporate entities provide you with some level of shielding against headaches. Typically, you are required to list a legal representative to act on your behalf to accept legal service and to answer complaints (an Agent for Service of Process). In the United States, this point of contact is the only public piece of information you are required to give anyone about your corporate entity. This point of contact doesn&#39;t have to be you, and organizations exist to provide this service at nominal fees ($50/yr). This means that if someone decides to pay a visit, they are visiting this publicly listed legal point of contact, as opposed to your home.</p>

<p>Third (but related to the above), a corporate entity immediately implicitly signals that you are legally savvy and not easily intimidated by empty legal threats. For example: for some reason, some companies see legal threats as better solutions to crawling abuse than say, <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/intro.html">implementing a captcha</a>. No one has yet brought suit against any Tor operator, but having a corporate entity as that operator tells any potential trigger-happy litigants that you are not likely to be easy pickings.</p>

<p>In the US, the cost of setting up an LLC with good privacy protections is between $100-$1000/yr, depending upon the state you incorporate in and the services you contract from independent providers (such as preparing and filing the paperwork for you, and phone+mail forwarding). States that have laws that make this process easy are Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, and to a lesser extent Delaware. States to avoid include Massachusetts and California (though the latter cannot be avoided if your ISP is also in California -- you must pay a $900 &#39;franchise fee&#39; to CA if you do most of your business there, regardless of incorporation).</p>

<p>You do not have to be a resident of a state to incorporate there. In fact, in most of the states listed above, you do not even have to be a US citizen. It is also never too late to switch your existing exit nodes from your personal control into the hands of a newly formed LLC. All you need to do is inform your ISP, and have the newly formed LLC begin paying the bill from its bank account.</p>

<p>We do not want to recommend specific services here, because we have not personally used them all, but full-service remote incorporation services for those states are easy to find on the web.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it! Happy operating!</p>
