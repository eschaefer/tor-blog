          <p><p>Jake, Arturo, and I went to <a href="http://arabloggers.com/blog/">Tunisia</a> Oct 3-7 to teach a bunch of bloggers from Arab countries about Tor and more generally about Internet security and privacy. The previous meetings were in Lebanon; it&#39;s amazing to reflect that the world has changed enough that <a href="http://samibengharbia.com/">Sami</a> can hold it in his home country now.</p>

<p>The conference was one day of keynotes with lots of press attention, and then three days of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>-style workshops.</p>

<p>On the keynote day, Jake and Arturo did a talk on mobile privacy, pointing out the wide variety of ways that the telephone network is &quot;the best surveillance tool ever invented&quot;. The highlight for the day was when Moez Chakchouk, the head of the Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI), did a talk explicitly stating that Tunisia had been using Smartfilter since 2002, that Smartfilter had been giving Tunisia discounts in exchange for beta-testing their products for other countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, and that it was time for Tunisia to stop wasting money on expensive filters that aren&#39;t good for the country anyway.</p>

<p>We did a four-hour Tor training on the first workshop day. We covered what to look for in a circumvention or privacy tool (open source good, open design good, open analysis of security properties good, centralization bad). All the attendees left with a working Tor Browser Bundle install (well, all the attendees except the fellow with the ipad). We got many of them to install <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> and <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a> as well, but ran into some demo bugs around the Jabber connect server config that derailed some users. I look forward to having the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-im-browser-bundle-discontinued-temporarily">Tor IM Browser Bundle</a> back in action now that we&#39;ve fixed some Pidgin security bugs.</p>

<p>We did a three-hour general security and privacy Q&amp;A on the second workshop day, covering topics like whether Skype is safe, how else can they do VoIP, how can they trust various software, a demo of what sniffing the network can show, iphone vs android vs blackberry, etc. It ended with a walk-through of how <em>*we*</em> keep our laptops secure, so people could see how far down the rabbit hole they can go.</p>

<p>Syria and Israel seem to be the scariest adversaries in the area right now, in terms of oppression technology and willingness to use it. Or said another way, if you live in Syria or Palestine, you are especially screwed. We heard some really sad and disturbing stories; but those stories aren&#39;t mine to tell here.</p>

<p>We helped to explain the implications of the 54 gigs of Bluecoat logs that got published from inside Syria, detailing URLs and the IP addresses that fetched them. (The IP addresses were scrubbed from the published version of the logs, but the URLs, user agents, timestamps, etc still contain quite sensitive info.)
 <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology-surveilling-syrian-citizens-online/" title="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology-surveilling-syrian-citizens-online/">http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology...</a></p>

<p>Perhaps most interesting in the Bluecoat logs is the evidence of Bluecoat devices phoning home to get updates. So much for Bluecoat&#39;s claims that they don&#39;t provide support to Syria. If the US government chose to enforce its existing laws against American companies selling surveillance tools to Syria, it would be a great step toward making Tor users safer in Syria right now: no doubt Syria has some smart people who can configure things locally, but it&#39;s way worse when Silicon Valley engineers provide new filter rules to detect protocols like Tor for no additional charge.</p>

<p>The pervasiveness of video cameras and journalists at the meeting was surprising. I&#39;m told the previous Arab blogger meeting was just a bunch of geeks sitting around their laptops talking about how to improve their countries and societies. Now that the Twitter Revolution is hot in the press, I guess all the Western media now want a piece of the action.</p>

<p>On the third workshop day we learned that there was a <a href="http://info-tunisie.net/high-tech/actualite/tic/21955-tunisie--iptelecom-expo-2011-les-6-et-7-octobre">surveillance corporate expo</a> happening in the same hotel as the blogger meeting. We crashed it and collected some brochures. We also found a pair of students from a nearby university who had set up a booth to single-handedly try to offset the evil of the expo. They were part of a security student group at their university that had made a magazine that talked among other things about Tor, Tunisian filtering, etc. We gave them a big pile of Tor stickers.</p>

<p>On our extra day after the workshops, we visited Moez at his Internet Agency and interviewed him for a few hours about the state of filtering in his country. He confirmed that they renewed their Smartfilter license until Sept 2012, and that they still filter &quot;the groups that want it&quot; (government and schools), but for technical reasons they have turned off the global filters (they broke and nobody has fixed them). We pointed out that since an external company operates their filters — including for their military — then that company not only has freedom to censor anything they want, but they also get to see every single request when deciding whether to censor it. Moez used the phrase &quot;national sovereignty&quot; when explaining why it isn&#39;t a great idea for Tunisia to outsource their filtering. Great point: it would be foolish to imagine that this external company isn&#39;t logging things for their own purposes, whether that&#39;s &quot;improving their product&quot; or something more sinister. As we keep seeing, collecting a large data set and then hoping to keep it secret never seems to work out.</p>

<p>One of the points Jake kept hammering on throughout the week was &quot;if <em>*anything*</em> is being filtered, then you have to realize that they&#39;re surveilling <em>*everything*</em> in order to make those filtering decisions.&quot; The Syrian logs help to drive the point home but it seems like a lot of people haven&#39;t really internalized it yet. We still find people thinking of Tor solely as an &quot;anti-filter&quot; tool and not considering the surveillance angle.</p>

<p>After the meeting with Moez, we went to visit one of the universities. We talked to a few dozen students who were really excited to find us there — to the point that they quickly located a video camera and interviewed us on the spot. They brought us to their security class, and informed the professor that we would be speaking for the first half hour of it. We gave an impassioned plea for them to learn more about Tor and teach other people in their country how to be safe online. I think the group of students there could be really valuable for creating local technical Tor resources. As a bonus, the traditional path for a computer science graduate of this university is to go work at Tunisia Telecom, the monopoly telco that hosts the filtering boxes &amp;mdash the more we can influence the incoming generations, the more the change will grow.</p>

          <p><p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to announce a new version for Vidalia, 0.2.15.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve Vidalia, please
remember to go to <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/" title="https://trac.torproject.org/">https://trac.torproject.org/</a> and file a ticket for it!</p>

<p>You can find the source tarball and its signature in here:

<p>TBB and other packages are going to be here soon, please be patient.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what changed:</p>

<p><strong>0.2.15 07-Oct-2011</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Draw the bandwidth graph curves based on the local maximum, not
the global maximum. Fixes bug 2188.</li>
<li>Add an option for setting up a non-exit relay to the Sharing
configuration panel. This is meant to clarify what an exit policy
and an exit relay are. Resolves bug 2644.</li>
<li>Display time statistics for bridges in UTC time, rather than local
time. Fixes bug 3342.</li>
<li>Change the parameter for ordering the entries in the Basic Log
list from currentTime to currentDateTime to avoid missplacing
entries from different days.</li>
<li>Check the tor version and that settings are sanitized before
trying to use the port autoconfiguration feature. Fixes bug 3843.</li>
<li>Provide a way to hide Dock or System Tray icons in OSX. Resolves
ticket 2163.</li>
<li>Make new processes appear at front when they are started (OSX
specific).</li>
</ul>

          <p><p>The Tor network is run by volunteers, and for the most part is entirely independent of the software development effort led by The Tor Project, Inc. While The Tor Project, Inc is a 501(c)3 non-profit that is <a href="https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en">happy to take donations</a> to create more and better software, up until recently there was no way for you to fund deployment of more relays to improve network capacity and performance, aside from running those relays yourself.</p>

<p>We&#39;re happy to announce that both <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Tor">Noisebridge</a> and <a href="https://www.torservers.net">TorServers.net</a> are now able to take donations directly for the purpose of running high capacity Tor exit nodes.</p>

<p>Noisebridge is a US 501(c)3 non-profit, which means that for US citizens, <a href="http://tor.noisebridge.net/">donations</a> are tax deductible. Torservers.net is a German non-profit organization whose <a href="https://www.torservers.net/donate.html">donations</a> are tax deductible for German citizens (and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62007J0318:EN:HTML">also potentially</a> for citizens of other EU member states).</p>

<p>What are the pluses and minuses of donating as opposed to running your own relay? Glad you asked!</p>

<p>While it is relatively easy and risk-free to run a middle relay or a bridge, running an exit can be tough. You have to seek out a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TheOnionRouter/GoodBadISPs">friendly ISP</a>, explain Tor to them, and then navigate a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node-minimal-harassment">laundry list of Internet bureaucracies</a> to ensure that when abuse happens, the burden of <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorAbuseTemplates">answering complaints</a> falls upon you and not your ISP.</p>

<p>These barriers are all made easier the larger your budget is. On top of this, like most things, bandwidth is cheaper in bulk. But not just <a href="http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?prodid=11487214">Costco cheaper</a>: exponential-growth cheaper, all the way up into the gigabit range (and perhaps beyond, but no one has run a Tor node on anything faster).</p>

<p>At these scales, large exit nodes can pay as little as $1/mo per dedicated megabit/second. Sometimes less. This means that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/subscriptions/business=treasurer%40noisebridge.net&amp;item_name=Noisebridge%20Tor%20Node%20Project&amp;cy_code=USD&amp;no_note=1&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;a3=30&amp;p3=1&amp;t3=M&amp;src=1">adding $30/mo</a> to the hosting budget of a large exit node can buy almost 40 times more full-duplex dedicated bandwidth than a similarly priced business upgrade to your home ADSL line would buy, and about 50 times more bandwidth than Amazon EC2 instances at the entry-level price of $0.08 per half-duplex gigabyte, not counting CPU costs. ( <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges">Bridge</a> economics in terms of IP address space availability might still favor Amazon EC2, but that is a different discussion).</p>

<p>The downside to donation is that network centralization can lead to a more fragile and a more observable network. If these nodes fail, the network will definitely feel the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html">performance</a> <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-September/021493.html">loss</a>. In terms of observability, fewer nodes also means that fewer points of surveillance are required to deanonymize users (though <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html">some argue</a> that more users will make such surveillance less reliable, no one has yet rigorously quantified that result against actual attacks).</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are able to run a high capacity relay or exit yourself (or have access to cheap/free/ <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/master:/contrib/linux-tor-prio.sh">unused</a> bandwidth at your work/school), running your own relay is definitely preferred. If you are part of the Tor community and want to accept donations, we&#39;d love to add you to our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#RelayDonations">recommended donor list</a>. Please join us on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays">tor-relays mailing list</a> to discuss <a href="https://github.com/noisetor/">node configuration</a> and <a href="https://www.torservers.net/wiki/guides">setup</a>.</p>

<p>However, if configuring and maintaining a high capacity relay is not for you, donating a portion of the monthly hosting budgets of either of these organizations is an excellent way to support anonymity, privacy, and censorship circumvention for very large numbers of people.</p>
