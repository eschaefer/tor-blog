        <p><p>We keep hearing from people around the world that clicking the 3 buttons to turn yourself into a bridge is too difficult todo for most users. These people have repeatedly asked for a &quot;bridge by default&quot; configuration in a package. Here it is: <a href="http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/" title="http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/">http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/</a></p>

<p>When you install and run this package, you are a bridge relay helping censored users around the world access Tor and the uncensored Internet.<br>
To understand more about bridges, read <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges" title="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">https://www.torproject.org/bridges</a>.</p>

<p>This is the installable Vidalia bundle configured to be a bridge by default. This is Tor 0.2.2.13-alpha, Vidalia 0.2.9, Polipo 1.0.4.1. The only difference between this bridge-bundle and the vidalia-bundle is the bridge configuration.</p>

<p>When started, Vidalia attempts to use UPnP to reconfigure any NAT/router device to open port 9001 for tor and 9030 for a directory mirror. The bandwidth is set to consume greater than 1.5 Mbps. It works just like the vidalia-bundle (because it is the vidalia-bundle) where if UPnP fails, it prompts you to open the correct ports on your NAT/router.</p>

<p>None of this is final configuration. It is merely a &quot;does it work for you?&quot; test package. So far, it&#39;s worked on the 4 different networks I&#39;ve tried. Apologies to the 300 Chinese users who used my bridge on one of the test networks, only to have it go away a day later.</p>

<p><em>Update 2010-06-11: Fixed a vidalia.conf issue which wasn&#39;t a problem, but looked like the controlport was open and un-authenticated. uploaded new binaries and removed the old ones. The bridge-bundle nsi file that creates this bundle is <a href="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/pkg/win32/bridge-bundle.nsi.in">in Vidalia svn</a>. Just replace vidalia-bundle.nsi.in with the bridge-bundle.nsi.in and create your bundle.</em></p>

        <p><p>Recently, a few articles have been published regarding Tor, <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a>, and snooping data coming out of the Tor network. I write to remind our users, and people in search of privacy enhancing technology, that good software is just one part of the solution. Education is just as important. This is why there is a <a href="//www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning">warning on the Tor download page</a> about what Tor does and does not do. We also have a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#CanexitnodeseavesdroponcommunicationsIsntthatbad">FAQ entry about this topic</a>. Any plaintext communication over the Internet is open to intercept. This is true if the transport mechanism is email, http, tor, or carrier pigeons. Tor does not magically encrypt the Internet from end to end. Tor does wrap your traffic in encrypted layers as it transports it through the Tor network. See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/images/htw3.png">this diagram</a> for a visual explanation.</p>

<p>Tor provides anonymity and privacy by hiding where your Internet traffic is going and where it came from, but users must protect the security of their traffic by using encryption. Once you exit the last relay, you are back on the open Internet. Some web email providers, banks, and other sites use encryption by default when you log in, something you can check by looking for &quot;https://&quot; at the beginning of a URL. For more information, check out <a href="http://ryansholin.com/2010/05/31/wikileaks-and-tor-moral-use-of-an-amoral-system/#comment-1769">Ethan Zuckerman&#39;s comments</a> on this topic.</p>

<p>For reference, these articles are unclear and blur concepts about Tor and Wikileaks. An article about Julian Assange of Wikileaks in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian">The New Yorker</a> is the source of the confusion. <a href="http://ryansholin.com/2010/05/31/wikileaks-and-tor-moral-use-of-an-amoral-system/">Ryan Sholin deliberates</a> on one paragraph from the New Yorker story. <a href="http://ethanzuckerman.com/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> responded to Ryan&#39;s thoughts about Tor <a href="http://ryansholin.com/2010/05/31/wikileaks-and-tor-moral-use-of-an-amoral-system/#comment-17691">here</a>. We thanked EthanZ for the accurate response in an <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/34289748">Identi.ca dent</a>. It seems <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/06/01/2334237/Wikileaks-Was-Launched-With-Intercepts-From-Tor">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/wikileaks-documents/">Wired Threat Level</a> have picked up on just that one statement in the article by the New Yorker.</p>

<p>We hear from the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/02/wikileaks_tor_snooping_denial/">Wikileaks folks</a> that <a href="http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/15220072701">the premise</a> behind these news articles is actually false -- they didn&#39;t bootstrap Wikileaks by monitoring the Tor network. But that&#39;s not the point. The point is that users who want to be safe need to be encrypting their traffic, whether they&#39;re using Tor or not.</p>

        <p><p>On May 20, we released Vidalia 0.2.9. Fixes include Qt 4.6.2 compatibility, new cert, and some new translations.</p>

<p>You can download it at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/" title="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/">https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/</a>. Packages are slowly being updated to include this version of Vidalia.</p>

<p>The full changelog is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the GoDaddy CA certificate bundle since we changed the certificate used to authenticate connections to geoips.vidalia-project.net for downloading GeoIP information from a commercial GoDaddy certificate to a free CACert certificate.</li>
<li>Define -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501 on Windows builds so that MiniUPnPc will build with the latest versions of MinGW.</li>
<li>Modify miniupnpc.c from MiniUPnPc&#39;s source so that it will build on Mac OS X 10.4.</li>
<li>Work around Qt&#39;s new behavior for the QT_WA macro so that Vidalia will<br>
work correctly again on Windows with Qt &gt;= 4.6.</li>
<li>Force CMake to include the *_RELEASE versions of Qt libraries when building a .dmg on Mac OS X, so that it will work with CMake &gt;= 2.8 as well.</li>
<li>Explicitly link zlib into src/common to avoid link errors on some older versions of Mac OS X.</li>
<li>Add Danish, Brazilian Portguese and Vietnamese translations.</li>
