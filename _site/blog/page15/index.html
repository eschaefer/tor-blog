          <p>Welcome to the twelfth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha is out</h1>

<p>Nick Mathewson cut <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032448.html">a new release</a> of the Tor development branch on March 23rd: “Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha includes all the fixes from 0.2.4.21. It contains two new anti-DoS features for Tor relays, resolves a bug that kept SOCKS5 support for IPv6 from working, fixes several annoying usability issues for bridge users, and removes more old code for unused directory formats.”</p>

<p>This release also marks the first step toward the stabilization of Tor 0.2.5, as from now on “no feature patches not already written will be considered for inclusion”.</p>

<p>The source is available at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">the usual location</a>, as are updated binary packages.</p>

<h1>Tails 0.23 is out…</h1>

<p>…but many Tails users are already running it. Now that incremental upgrades have been turned on by default with the previous release, users of Tails on USB sticks have been able to enjoy the process of a smooth upgrade in three clicks.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.23/">the new release</a> fixes several <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.22.1/">security holes</a>. That alone should make anyone switch, but the new version finally brings with it two long-awaited features and many small improvements.</p>

<p>Tails will now do “MAC spoofing” by default. To hide the hardware address used on the local network, Tails will now use a randomized address by default. This will help prevent the tracking of one’s geographical location across networks. For more information about MAC spoofing, why it matters, and when it might be relevant to turn it off, be sure to read the very well-written <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Another important feature is the integrated support for proxies and Tor bridges. This should be of immense help to users of Tails on censored networks. The integration is done using the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git">Tor Launcher extension</a>, familiar to everyone who has used recent versions of the Tor Browser.</p>

<p>For examples of smaller features and bugfixes: Tor, obfsproxy, I2P, Pidgin and the web browser have been upgraded, a 64-bit kernel is used on most systems to pave the way for UEFI support, documentation is now accessible from the greeter, and the “New identity” option in the browser is available again.</p>

<p>The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29th and will be 1.0. For this important milestone in 5 years of intense work, the Tails team is still looking for a <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/logo_contest/">logo</a>.</p>

<h1>New Tor Browser releases</h1>

<p>The Tor Browser team put out two new releases based on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.4">Firefox 24.4.0esr</a>. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-353-released">Version 3.5.3</a> is meant as a safe upgrade for every Tor Browser user. Among other changes, the new version contains an updated Tor, a fix for a potential freeze, a fix for the Ubuntu keyboard issue and a way to prevent disk leaks when watching videos.</p>

<p>On top of the preceding changes, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-beta-1-released">version 3.6-beta-1</a> is the culmination of a months-long effort to seamlessly integrate <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transports</a> into the Tor Browser. In the network settings, users can now choose “Connect with provided bridges” and select from <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt">“obfs3”</a>, <a href="https://fteproxy.org/">“fte”</a> or <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">“flashproxy”</a>. Entering custom bridges is also supported and will work for direct, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges.</p>

<p>Other usability changes include wording improvements in the connection wizard, translatable Tor status messages, and the use of disk image (DMG) instead of ZIP archives for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Please upgrade, in any case, and consider helping iron out the remaining issues in the 3.6 branch.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Since the 3.5 release, “Tor Browser Bundle is more like a standalone browser and less like a bundle”. This led the Tor Browser team to plan to <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11193">“rename it to just ‘Tor Browser’ everywhere”</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000491.html">Berkay</a> and to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000492.html">André Schulz</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!</p>

<p>Alex <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032441.html">reported</a> an “important case about Tor relay operators” which came to court in Athens, Greece on March 18th. The defendant, a Tor relay operator, was acquitted after proving that the IP address used for criminal activity was in fact a Tor relay.</p>

<p>Connections to Twitter from inside Turkey were <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/03/after-dns-change-fails-turkish-government-steps-up-twitter-censorship/">blocked by the Turkish government</a> on 20th March, leading to <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-relay-country&amp;start=2014-01-01&amp;end=2014-03-26&amp;country=tr&amp;events=off#userstats-relay-country">an increase</a> in the number of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26714214">Tor users there</a>.</p>

<p>Jacob Appelbaum presented a keynote titled “Free software for freedom, surveillance and you” at <a href="http://libreplanet.org/2014/program/sessions.html">LibrePlanet 2014</a>. The presentation was done remotely from Berlin using Tor and <a href="https://github.com/ioerror/freenote">GStreamer</a>.</p>

<p>James Valleroy wrote to tor-relays asking the best way to configure the FreedomBox as a Tor bridge. Lance Hathaway explained about pluggable transports and Roger Dingledine mentioned the potential issues of relaying a bridge and a hidden service at the same time.</p>

<p>Aymeric Vitte <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032432.html">wrote</a> to tor-talk to mention an implementation of the Tor protocol in JavaScript. Sadly, the project is not free software yet.</p>

<p>A Tor exit operator recently <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20243q/iaman_operator_of_eight_tor_relays_including_two">held an Ask Me Anything</a> on Reddit, which was quite successful, generating over 800 upvotes, 478 comments, and being read by thousands. The most popular questions were focused on how to improve the use of Tor, the legality of exit nodes, discussions on hidden services, the workings of Tor, and many other topics related to privacy and security.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users sometimes want to know how to transfer their bookmarks from an old Tor Browser to an updated one. Mozilla provide instructions on how to do this on their <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">website</a>.</p>

<p>The new Tor Browser releases were again prevented from working properly by WebRoot Internet Security. The error message is “Couldn’t load XPCOM”. Users need to disable WebRoot, whitelist the appropriate Tor Browser files, and more importantly contact WebRoot support to warn them that their product is breaking the Tor Browser and, to the best of Tor support’s knowledge, Firefox stable releases. Ideally, WebRoot should test new releases before harming Tor users. See <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11268">#11268</a> if you want to help.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>uighur1984 wanted to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1783/88">set up a hidden service for their public-facing website</a> and decided that the HiddenServiceDir should be the same like the DocumentRoot of the website. This led to some problems with access rights. Sam Whited clarified that both directories should be separated: the data in the HiddenServiceDir doesn&#39;t contain any actual data from the website, but only the keys and other information from the hidden service.</p>

<p>Gondalse shot a video showing policemen torturing a citizen. The release of the video led to a trial, and Gondalse <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1790/88">fears that someone might try to track the owner of the video down</a>. Jens Kubieziel pointed out some OPSEC rules, and showed which problems can lead to deanonymization.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the eleventh issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Accessing the Tor network from China</h1>

<p>In a new blog post <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-read-our-china-usage-graphs">How to read our China usage graphs</a>, Roger Dingledine looks at the current situation of how Tor is able to circumvent censorship on Chinese Internet accesses. Indeed, if one only looks at the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-country&amp;start=2011-10-18&amp;end=2014-01-16&amp;country=cn#userstats-bridge-country">current bridge users graph</a>, one might believe that Tor is not a solution for users in China.</p>

<p>“The correct interpretation of the graph is ‘obfs3 bridges have not been deployed enough to keep up with the demand in China’. So it isn’t that Tor is blocked — it’s that we haven’t done much of a deployment for obfs3 bridges or ScrambleSuit bridges, which are the latest steps in the arms race” writes Roger.</p>

<p>The upcoming version — <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-March/000364.html">currently in QA phase</a> — of the Tor Browser will include support for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transports</a> <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt">obfs3</a>, <a href="https://fteproxy.org/">FTE</a> and <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">Flashproxy</a>. Having these transports ready to be used in a couple of clicks should help Chinese users.</p>

<p>The “obfs3” protocol is still vulnerable to active probing attacks. The deployment of its replacement, <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/">ScrambleSuit</a>, is on-going. As Roger highlighted, “we need to get more addresses”. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses">Several ways have been thoughts in the past</a>, but until there is more cooperation from ISP and network operators, your can make a difference by <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html">running a bridge</a> if you can!</p>

<p>On another front, work is currently on-going on the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git">bridge distributor</a> to improve how censored users can get a hand on bridge addresses. Yawning Angel also <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006476.html">just released</a> the first version of <a href="https://github.com/Yawning/obfsclient">obfsclient</a> which should help making ScrambleSuit available on Android devices. All in all, the Tor community can hope to welcome back more users from China in a near future.</p>

<h1>Circumventing censorship through “too-big-too-block” websites</h1>

<p>Late January, David Fifield <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006159.html">introduced</a> a new pluggable transport called <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>. It can be described as “a transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server (Google App Engine). It uses a trick to talk to the third party so that it looks like it is talking to an unblocked server.” The approach is close to the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoAgent">GoAgent</a> proxy that has a certain popularity in China.</p>

<p>With the current version, using Google App Engine, the transport requires no additional configuration. But David also mentioned that <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10984">a PHP script</a> could also be a good candidate to relay the traffic. Combined to <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/">ScrambleSuit</a>, it could allow “a real web site with real pages and everything” to be used as a bridge if a user can provide the shared secret.</p>

<p>David has made available <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000340.html">experimental versions</a> of the Tor Browser for anyone to try. The <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/meek.git">source code</a> has recently <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006506.html">moved</a> to the Tor Project’s infrastructure, and is ready for more eyes and fingers to play with it.</p>

<h1>Switching to a single guard node?</h1>

<p>Last October, Roger Dingledine called for research on <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters">improving Tor’s anonymity by changing guard parameters </a>. One of these parameters is the number of guard nodes used simultaneously by a Tor client.</p>

<p>Following up on the <a href="http://freehaven.net/%7Earma/cogs-wpes.pdf">paper written by Tariq Elahi et al.</a>, Roger’s blog post, and recent discussions during the winter dev. meeting, George Kadianakis made a detailed <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006458.html">analysis of the implications of switching to a single guard node </a>. He studied the performance implications of switching to a single guard, the performance implications of raising the minimum guard bandwidth for both clients and the overall network, and how the change would affect the overall anonymity and fingerprintability of Tor users.</p>

<p>Jumping to conclusions: “It seems that the performance implications of switching to 1 guard are not terrible. […] A guard bandwidth threshold of 2MB/s […] seems like it would considerably improve client performance without screwing terribly with the security or the total performance of the network. The fingerprinting problem will be improved in some cases, but still remains unsolved for many of the users […] A proper solution might involve <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9273#comment:4">guard node buckets</a>”.</p>

<p>For a better understanding, be sure to look at George’s work which includes graphs and proper explanations.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>George Kadianakis <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004074.html">announced</a> obfsproxy version 0.2.7. The new release fixes <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/11100">an important bug</a> “where scramblesuit would basically reject clients if they try to connect a second time after a short amount of time has passed.” Bridge operators are strongly advised to upgrade from <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/commit/6cdbc64">source</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obfsproxy/0.2.7">pip</a>, or the upcoming Debian packages.</p>

<p>The submission deadline for this year’s <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-google-summer-code-2014">Google Summer of Code</a> is the 21st: this Friday. Several students already showed up on the tor-dev mailing list, but as Damian Johnson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006498.html">says</a>: “If you’re procrastinating until the last minute then please don’t!”</p>

<p>Tails <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/">logo contest</a> is happily on-going. Several submissions have already been received and can be seen on the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/logo/">relevant blueprint</a>.</p>

<p>Kelley Misata and Karen Reilly <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000485.html">attended the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive festival</a> in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>Relay and bridge operators might be interested in Ramo’s <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004062.html">first release</a> of <a href="https://github.com/goodvikings/tor_nagios">a Tor plugin for Nagios</a>. It can currently check for a page fetch through the SOCKS proxy port, the hibernation state, the current bandwidth, ORPort reachability, DirPort reachability, and the bytes remaining until hibernation.</p>

<p>Nicolas Vigier sent his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000486.html">monthly report for February</a>.</p>

<p>Tails <a href="https://twitter.com/accessnow/status/441043400708857856">won the 2014 Endpoint Security prize</a> from Access. The prize <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/prize">recognizes</a> Tails “unique positive impact on the endpoint security of at-risk users in need”. Congrats!</p>

<p>The Format-Transforming Encryption project at Portland State University <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2014/03/psu_professor_wins_surprise_10.html">received</a> an unexpected 100,000 USD grant from Eric Schmidt.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>The help desk has seen an increase in Russian language support requests amidst news that the Russian Federation began censoring a number of websites. Unfortunately, the help desk is not able to provide support in Russian for now. Changes in the number of Tor users by country can be observed on the project’s <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html">metrics page</a>.</p>

          <p>Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.23, is out.</p>

<p>All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes <a href="https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.22.1/index.en.html">numerous security issues</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<p>Notable user-visible changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Security fixes</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox
24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major new features</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing/index.en.html">Spoof the network interfaces&#39; MAC address</a>
by default. It can be disabled in Tails Greeter.</li>
<li>Rework the way to
<a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/network_configuration/index.en.html">configure how Tor connects to the network</a>
by using bridges, proxies and restrictive firewalls. This option
can be set from Tails Greeter, and replaces the old
experimental &quot;bridge mode&quot; feature.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bugfixes</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled.</li>
<li>Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced in the 2.10.8 security update.</li>
<li>Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time, before checking for upgrades and unfixed known security issues.</li>
<li>Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver. We don&#39;t need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down.</li>
<li>Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available in Windows Camouflage mode.</li>
<li>Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor improvements</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.</li>
<li>Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.</li>
<li>Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.</li>
<li>Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one. This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.</li>
<li>Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).</li>
<li>Disable the autologin text consoles. This was one of the blockers before a screen saver can be installed in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy, the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.</li>
<li>Make it possible to manually start IBus.</li>
<li>Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser, using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving full control over Tor to the desktop user.</li>
<li>Incremental upgrades improvements:</li>
<li>Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users&#39; confusion.</li>
<li>Lock down sudo credentials a bit.</li>
<li>Hide debugging information.</li>
<li>Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports. This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.</li>
<li>Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done.</li>
<li>Various user interface and phrasing improvements.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t install the Cookie Monster browser extension.</li>
<li>Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor&#39;s Stack Exchange.</li>
<li>Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently, too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support nightmare.</li>
<li>Use (most of) Tor Browser&#39;s mozconfig.</li>
<li>Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get the certificate authorities added by Debian back.</li>
<li>Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.</li>
<li>Hide Tails Greeter&#39;s password mismatch warning when entry is changed.</li>
<li>Persistent Volume Assistant:</li>
<li>Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.</li>
<li>Optimize window height.</li>
<li>Display device paths in a more user-friendly way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

          <p>The Tor Browser team is proud to release the first beta in the 3.6 series. Packages are available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-beta">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-1/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This beta features fully integrated Pluggable Transport support, including an improved Tor Launcher UI for configuring Pluggable Transport bridges. The Pluggable Transport code is also fully disabled for users who do not configure them.</p>

<p>We believe that this approach will allow us to quickly turn 3.6 into a stable release, perhaps as soon as the next point release of TBB.</p>

<p>This release also changes the MacOS archive format from zip to DMG, which should improve installation usability for Mac users.</p>

<p>This release also includes <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.4">important security updates to Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBGeneral">TBB FAQ listing</a> for any issues you may have before contacting support or filing tickets. In particular, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBB3.x">TBB 3.x section</a> lists common issues specific to the Tor Browser 3.x series.</p>
