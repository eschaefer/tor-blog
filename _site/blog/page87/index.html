        <div class="post-description">
          <p>After over a year it&#39;s about time that I announced an arm release so here it is! What&#39;s new since <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2009/msg00040.html">August of 2009</a>, you ask? Lots. The project has been under very active development, continuing to add usability improvements to make relay operation nicer and less error prone. If you&#39;re really curious what I&#39;ve been up to this last year then it&#39;s all available in the <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/log.php">change log</a>.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, arm is a terminal monitor for Tor relays and, to a growing extent, end users. It provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)</li>
<li>general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags, or/dir/controlports)</li>
<li>event log with optional regex filtering and deduplication</li>
<li>connections correlated against tor&#39;s consensus data (ip, connection types, relay details, etc)</li>
<li>an editor to quickly alter Tor&#39;s configuration</li>
<li>torrc configuration file with syntax highlighting and validation</li>
</ul>

<p>and quite a bit more via a curses interface. For screenshots and downloads visit:
_ <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">http://www.atagar.com/arm/</a>_</p>

<p>Peter and I are currently working on getting its debs in shape so hopefully this&#39;ll soon be available via repositories for Debian and Ubuntu too. RPM builds are available, though I don&#39;t have a test system so beware: there be dragons (possibly).</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any python hackers out there interested in dabbling in a bit of Tor UI development, then I&#39;d love to have some company. Suggestions, bug reports and feedback are also be very welcome. Cheers! -Damian</p>

          <p>Yet another OpenSSL security patch broke its compatibility with Tor:
Tor 0.2.2.19-alpha makes relays work with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and 1.0.0.b.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p>The original announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.19-alpha - 2010-11-21
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an incompatibility with openssl 0.9.8p and openssl 1.0.0b:
No longer set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects;
but continue to set it on client SSL objects. Our goal in setting
it was to imitate a browser, not a vhosting server. Fixes bug 2204;
bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try harder not to exceed the maximum length of 50 KB when writing
statistics to extra-info descriptors. This bug was triggered by very
fast relays reporting exit-port, entry, and dirreq statistics.
Reported by Olaf Selke. Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha. Fixes bug 2183.</li>
<li>Publish a router descriptor even if generating an extra-info
descriptor fails. Previously we would not publish a router
descriptor without an extra-info descriptor; this can cause fast
exit relays collecting exit-port statistics to drop from the
consensus. Bugfix on 0.1.2.9-rc; fixes bug 2195.</li>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.27 - 2010-11-23
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an incompatibility with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and OpenSSL 1.0.0b: No longer set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects; but continue to set it on client SSL objects. Our goal in setting
it was to imitate a browser, not a vhosting server. Fixes bug 2204; bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals
of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125; fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.</li>
<li>Learn our external IP address when we&#39;re a relay or bridge, even if we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,
where we introduced bridge relays that don&#39;t need to publish to be useful. Fixes bug 2050.</li>
<li>Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache. Previously
we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache them to disk anyway. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re using bridges and your network goes away and your bridges get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks
connection (if the network is back), rather than waiting up to an hour to try fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on
0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1981.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Move to the November 2010 Maxmind GeoLite country db (rather than the June 2009 ip-to-country GeoIP db) for our statistics that
count how many users relays are seeing from each country. Now we&#39;ll have more accurate data, especially for many African countries.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up maatuska (run by Linus Nordberg) as the eighth v3 directory authority.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix an assertion failure that could occur in directory caches or bridge users when using a very short voting interval on a testing network. Diagnosed by Robert Hogan. Fixes bug 1141; bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.</li>
<li>Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.</li>
<li>Allow handshaking OR connections to take a full KeepalivePeriod seconds to handshake. Previously, we would close them after IDLE_OR_CONN_TIMEOUT (180) seconds, the same timeout as if they were open. Bugfix on 0.2.1.26; fixes bug 1840. Thanks to mingw-san for analysis help.</li>
<li>When building with --enable-gcc-warnings on OpenBSD, disable warnings in system headers. This makes --enable-gcc-warnings pass on OpenBSD 4.8.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Exit nodes didn&#39;t recognize EHOSTUNREACH as a plausible error code, and so sent back END_STREAM_REASON_MISC. Clients now recognize a new stream ending reason for this case: END_STREAM_REASON_NOROUTE. Servers can start sending this code when enough clients recognize it. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc; fixes part of bug 1793.</li>
<li>Build correctly on mingw with more recent versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8. Patch from mingw-san.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Removed files:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the old debian/ directory from the main Tor distribution. The official Tor-for-debian git repository lives at the URL <a href="https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git" title="https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git">https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git</a></li>
<li>Stop shipping the old doc/website/ directory in the tarball. We changed the website format in late 2010, and what we shipped in 0.2.1.26 really wasn&#39;t that useful anyway.</li>

          <p>Tor 0.2.2.18-alpha fixes several crash bugs that have been nagging us lately, makes unpublished bridge relays able to detect their IP address, and fixes a wide variety of other bugs to get us much closer to a stable release.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p>Packages will be appearing over the next few days. The original version of this announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html</a>.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.18-alpha - 2010-11-16
 o Major bugfixes:
 - Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on
 router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache. Previously
 we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache them to disk
 anyway. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.
 - Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer
 freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection
 try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals
 of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125;
 fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.
 - Learn our external IP address when we&#39;re a relay or bridge, even if
 we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,
 where we introduced bridge relays that don&#39;t need to publish to
 be useful. Fixes bug 2050.
 - Maintain separate TLS contexts and certificates for incoming and
 outgoing connections in bridge relays. Previously we would use the
 same TLS contexts and certs for incoming and outgoing connections.
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses bug 988.
 - Maintain separate identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS
 contexts in bridge relays. Previously we would use the same
 identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS contexts. Bugfix on
 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses the other half of bug 988.
 - Avoid an assertion failure when we as an authority receive a
 duplicate upload of a router descriptor that we already have,
 but which we previously considered an obsolete descriptor.
 Fixes another case of bug 1776. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha.
 - Avoid a crash bug triggered by looking at a dangling pointer while
 setting the network status consensus. Found by Robert Ransom.
 Bugfix on 0.2.2.17-alpha. Fixes bug 2097.
 - Fix a logic error where servers that _didn&#39;t_ act as exits would
 try to keep their server lists more aggressively up to date than
 exits, when it was supposed to be the other way around. Bugfix
 on 0.2.2.17-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.1.x and earlier):
 - When we&#39;re trying to guess whether we know our IP address as
 a relay, we would log various ways that we failed to guess
 our address, but never log that we ended up guessing it
 successfully. Now add a log line to help confused and anxious
 relay operators. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1534.
 - Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the
 acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from
 getting locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a
 path (due to a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because
 its OR is not listed yet. It also prevents Tor clients from using an
 OR running in the same instance as an exit (due to a .exit request)
 if the OR does not meet the same requirements expected of an OR
 running elsewhere. Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
 - Correctly describe errors that occur when generating a TLS object.
 Previously we would attribute them to a failure while generating a
 TLS context. Patch by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc; fixes
 bug 1994.
 - Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on
 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.
 - Fix warnings that newer versions of autoconf produced during
 ./autogen.sh. These warnings appear to be harmless in our case,
 but they were extremely verbose. Fixes bug 2020.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x):
 - Enable protection of small arrays whenever we build with gcc
 hardening features, not only when also building with warnings
 enabled. Fixes bug 2031; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha. Reported by keb.</p>

<p>o Minor features:
 - Make hidden services work better in private Tor networks by not
 requiring any uptime to join the hidden service descriptor
 DHT. Implements ticket 2088.
 - Rate-limit the &quot;your application is giving Tor only an IP address&quot;
 warning. Addresses bug 2000; bugfix on 0.0.8pre2.
 - When AllowSingleHopExits is set, print a warning to explain to the
 relay operator why most clients are avoiding her relay.
 - Update to the November 1 2010 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</p>

<p>o Code simplifications and refactoring:
 - When we fixed bug 1038 we had to put in a restriction not to send
 RELAY_EARLY cells on rend circuits. This was necessary as long
 as relays using Tor 0.2.1.3-alpha through 0.2.1.18-alpha were
 active. Now remove this obsolete check. Resolves bug 2081.
 - Some options used different conventions for uppercasing of acronyms
 when comparing manpage and source. Fix those in favor of the
 manpage, as it makes sense to capitalize acronyms.
 - Remove the torrc.complete file. It hasn&#39;t been kept up to date
 and users will have better luck checking out the manpage.
 - Remove the obsolete &quot;NoPublish&quot; option; it has been flagged
 as obsolete and has produced a warning since 0.1.1.18-rc.
 - Remove everything related to building the expert bundle for OS X.
 It has confused many users, doesn&#39;t work right on OS X 10.6,
 and is hard to get rid of once installed. Resolves bug 1274.</p>
