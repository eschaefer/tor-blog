        <p><p>After over a year it&#39;s about time that I announced an arm release so here it is! What&#39;s new since <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2009/msg00040.html">August of 2009</a>, you ask? Lots. The project has been under very active development, continuing to add usability improvements to make relay operation nicer and less error prone. If you&#39;re really curious what I&#39;ve been up to this last year then it&#39;s all available in the <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/log.php">change log</a>.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, arm is a terminal monitor for Tor relays and, to a growing extent, end users. It provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)</li>
<li>general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags, or/dir/controlports)</li>
<li>event log with optional regex filtering and deduplication</li>
<li>connections correlated against tor&#39;s consensus data (ip, connection types, relay details, etc)</li>
<li>an editor to quickly alter Tor&#39;s configuration</li>
<li>torrc configuration file with syntax highlighting and validation</li>
</ul>

<p>and quite a bit more via a curses interface. For screenshots and downloads visit:<br>
_ <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">http://www.atagar.com/arm/</a>_</p>

<p>Peter and I are currently working on getting its debs in shape so hopefully this&#39;ll soon be available via repositories for Debian and Ubuntu too. RPM builds are available, though I don&#39;t have a test system so beware: there be dragons (possibly).</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any python hackers out there interested in dabbling in a bit of Tor UI development, then I&#39;d love to have some company. Suggestions, bug reports and feedback are also be very welcome. Cheers! -Damian</p>

        <p><p>Yet another OpenSSL security patch broke its compatibility with Tor:<br>
Tor 0.2.2.19-alpha makes relays work with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and 1.0.0.b.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p>The original announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00172.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.19-alpha - 2010-11-21<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an incompatibility with openssl 0.9.8p and openssl 1.0.0b:<br>
No longer set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects;<br>
but continue to set it on client SSL objects. Our goal in setting<br>
it was to imitate a browser, not a vhosting server. Fixes bug 2204;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try harder not to exceed the maximum length of 50 KB when writing<br>
statistics to extra-info descriptors. This bug was triggered by very<br>
fast relays reporting exit-port, entry, and dirreq statistics.<br>
Reported by Olaf Selke. Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha. Fixes bug 2183.</li>
<li>Publish a router descriptor even if generating an extra-info<br>
descriptor fails. Previously we would not publish a router<br>
descriptor without an extra-info descriptor; this can cause fast<br>
exit relays collecting exit-port statistics to drop from the<br>
consensus. Bugfix on 0.1.2.9-rc; fixes bug 2195.</li>

        <p><p>Tor 0.2.1.27 makes relays work with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and 1.0.0.b --yet another OpenSSL security patch broke its compatibility with Tor. We also took this opportunity to fix several crash bugs, integrate a new directory authority, and update the bundled GeoIP database.</p>

<p>If you operate a relay, please upgrade.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.27 - 2010-11-23<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an incompatibility with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and OpenSSL 1.0.0b: No longer set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects; but continue to set it on client SSL objects. Our goal in setting<br>
it was to imitate a browser, not a vhosting server. Fixes bug 2204; bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals<br>
of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125; fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.</li>
<li>Learn our external IP address when we&#39;re a relay or bridge, even if we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,<br>
where we introduced bridge relays that don&#39;t need to publish to be useful. Fixes bug 2050.</li>
<li>Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache. Previously<br>
we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache them to disk anyway. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re using bridges and your network goes away and your bridges get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks<br>
connection (if the network is back), rather than waiting up to an hour to try fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1981.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Move to the November 2010 Maxmind GeoLite country db (rather than the June 2009 ip-to-country GeoIP db) for our statistics that<br>
count how many users relays are seeing from each country. Now we&#39;ll have more accurate data, especially for many African countries.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New directory authorities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up maatuska (run by Linus Nordberg) as the eighth v3 directory authority.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix an assertion failure that could occur in directory caches or bridge users when using a very short voting interval on a testing network. Diagnosed by Robert Hogan. Fixes bug 1141; bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.</li>
<li>Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.</li>
<li>Allow handshaking OR connections to take a full KeepalivePeriod seconds to handshake. Previously, we would close them after IDLE_OR_CONN_TIMEOUT (180) seconds, the same timeout as if they were open. Bugfix on 0.2.1.26; fixes bug 1840. Thanks to mingw-san for analysis help.</li>
<li>When building with --enable-gcc-warnings on OpenBSD, disable warnings in system headers. This makes --enable-gcc-warnings pass on OpenBSD 4.8.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Exit nodes didn&#39;t recognize EHOSTUNREACH as a plausible error code, and so sent back END_STREAM_REASON_MISC. Clients now recognize a new stream ending reason for this case: END_STREAM_REASON_NOROUTE. Servers can start sending this code when enough clients recognize it. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc; fixes part of bug 1793.</li>
<li>Build correctly on mingw with more recent versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8. Patch from mingw-san.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Removed files:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the old debian/ directory from the main Tor distribution. The official Tor-for-debian git repository lives at the URL <a href="https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git" title="https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git">https://git.torproject.org/debian/tor.git</a></li>
<li>Stop shipping the old doc/website/ directory in the tarball. We changed the website format in late 2010, and what we shipped in 0.2.1.26 really wasn&#39;t that useful anyway.</li>

        <p><p>Tor 0.2.2.18-alpha fixes several crash bugs that have been nagging us lately, makes unpublished bridge relays able to detect their IP address, and fixes a wide variety of other bugs to get us much closer to a stable release.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p>Packages will be appearing over the next few days. The original version of this announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html</a>.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.18-alpha - 2010-11-16<br>
 o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on<br>
 router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache. Previously<br>
 we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache them to disk<br>
 anyway. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.<br>
 - Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer<br>
 freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection<br>
 try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals<br>
 of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125;<br>
 fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.<br>
 - Learn our external IP address when we&#39;re a relay or bridge, even if<br>
 we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,<br>
 where we introduced bridge relays that don&#39;t need to publish to<br>
 be useful. Fixes bug 2050.<br>
 - Maintain separate TLS contexts and certificates for incoming and<br>
 outgoing connections in bridge relays. Previously we would use the<br>
 same TLS contexts and certs for incoming and outgoing connections.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses bug 988.<br>
 - Maintain separate identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS<br>
 contexts in bridge relays. Previously we would use the same<br>
 identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS contexts. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses the other half of bug 988.<br>
 - Avoid an assertion failure when we as an authority receive a<br>
 duplicate upload of a router descriptor that we already have,<br>
 but which we previously considered an obsolete descriptor.<br>
 Fixes another case of bug 1776. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha.<br>
 - Avoid a crash bug triggered by looking at a dangling pointer while<br>
 setting the network status consensus. Found by Robert Ransom.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.2.17-alpha. Fixes bug 2097.<br>
 - Fix a logic error where servers that _didn&#39;t_ act as exits would<br>
 try to keep their server lists more aggressively up to date than<br>
 exits, when it was supposed to be the other way around. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.2.17-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.1.x and earlier):<br>
 - When we&#39;re trying to guess whether we know our IP address as<br>
 a relay, we would log various ways that we failed to guess<br>
 our address, but never log that we ended up guessing it<br>
 successfully. Now add a log line to help confused and anxious<br>
 relay operators. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1534.<br>
 - Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the<br>
 acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from<br>
 getting locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a<br>
 path (due to a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because<br>
 its OR is not listed yet. It also prevents Tor clients from using an<br>
 OR running in the same instance as an exit (due to a .exit request)<br>
 if the OR does not meet the same requirements expected of an OR<br>
 running elsewhere. Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.<br>
 - Correctly describe errors that occur when generating a TLS object.<br>
 Previously we would attribute them to a failure while generating a<br>
 TLS context. Patch by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc; fixes<br>
 bug 1994.<br>
 - Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.<br>
 - Fix warnings that newer versions of autoconf produced during<br>
 ./autogen.sh. These warnings appear to be harmless in our case,<br>
 but they were extremely verbose. Fixes bug 2020.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x):<br>
 - Enable protection of small arrays whenever we build with gcc<br>
 hardening features, not only when also building with warnings<br>
 enabled. Fixes bug 2031; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha. Reported by keb.</p>

<p>o Minor features:<br>
 - Make hidden services work better in private Tor networks by not<br>
 requiring any uptime to join the hidden service descriptor<br>
 DHT. Implements ticket 2088.<br>
 - Rate-limit the &quot;your application is giving Tor only an IP address&quot;<br>
 warning. Addresses bug 2000; bugfix on 0.0.8pre2.<br>
 - When AllowSingleHopExits is set, print a warning to explain to the<br>
 relay operator why most clients are avoiding her relay.<br>
 - Update to the November 1 2010 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</p>

<p>o Code simplifications and refactoring:<br>
 - When we fixed bug 1038 we had to put in a restriction not to send<br>
 RELAY_EARLY cells on rend circuits. This was necessary as long<br>
 as relays using Tor 0.2.1.3-alpha through 0.2.1.18-alpha were<br>
 active. Now remove this obsolete check. Resolves bug 2081.<br>
 - Some options used different conventions for uppercasing of acronyms<br>
 when comparing manpage and source. Fix those in favor of the<br>
 manpage, as it makes sense to capitalize acronyms.<br>
 - Remove the torrc.complete file. It hasn&#39;t been kept up to date<br>
 and users will have better luck checking out the manpage.<br>
 - Remove the obsolete &quot;NoPublish&quot; option; it has been flagged<br>
 as obsolete and has produced a warning since 0.1.1.18-rc.<br>
 - Remove everything related to building the expert bundle for OS X.<br>
 It has confused many users, doesn&#39;t work right on OS X 10.6,<br>
 and is hard to get rid of once installed. Resolves bug 1274.</p>
