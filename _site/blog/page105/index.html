          <p>Over the past month I&#39;ve been working with a few people from Poland. We are discussing how we can improve the impression of Tor in country. It seems a few people want to make all anonymity and privacy tools illegal; and tor is a well-known scapegoat. Thanks to the efforts of Paweł Wilk for writing a few sane articles about online privacy and Tor in particular.</p>

<p>Sywlia Presley of Global Voices writes up a great overview of the situation at <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/10/poland-discussions-of-tor-and-internet-filtering/" title="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/10/poland-discussions-of-tor-and-internet-filtering/">http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/01/10/poland-discussions-of-tor-and-i...</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since had conversations with the KidProtect.pl organization, which is somehow involved in all of this. We had a surprisingly sane conversation about Tor, online anonymity, and what they&#39;re running into when trying to track down child pornographers online. I hope to be visiting Poland in the near future to talk to more people face to face, do some more advocacy for online privacy, and to explain why Internet censorship is ineffective in stopping crime and criminals. I&#39;ve heard before that civil societies have no place for online privacy or anonymity, because it&#39;s only useful for repressive regimes. In a nutshell, the answer is the &quot;Who uses Tor?&quot; page, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torusers" title="https://www.torproject.org/torusers">https://www.torproject.org/torusers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the reasons Roger and I talk to law enforcement organizations around the world is to introduce Tor in a positive light. It&#39;s very hard to change a mindset if the first time you&#39;re introduced to Tor is while tracking down a criminal. You may assume only criminals use Tor (you would be wrong). If we can talk to law enforcement first, they may look at Tor in a different light. Our &quot;Who uses Tor?&quot; page, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torusers" title="https://www.torproject.org/torusers">https://www.torproject.org/torusers</a>, gives a number of real-world examples of who uses Tor. Over the past year, we&#39;ve built up a number of contacts in law enforcement who are willing to talk to their peers about what they know about Tor, what is a waste of time, and how they themselves use Tor to do their jobs and carry out their mission.</p>

<p>Anonymity loves company.</p>

          <p>Roger recently gave a talk at <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3554.en.html">26C3</a> about our experiences with various censorship technologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of the Iranian elections in June, and then the late September blockings in China, we&#39;ve learned a lot about how circumvention tools work in reality for activists in tough situations. I&#39;ll give an overview of the Tor architecture, and summarize the variety of people who use it and what security it provides. Then we&#39;ll focus on the use of tools like Tor in countries like Iran and China: why anonymity is important for circumvention, why transparency in design and operation is critical for trust, the role of popular media in helping – and harming – the effectiveness of the tools, and tradeoffs between usability and security. After describing Tor&#39;s strategy for secure circumvention (what we thought would work), I&#39;ll talk about how the arms race actually seems to be going in practice.</p>

          <p>Tor 0.2.1.21 fixes an incompatibility with the most recent OpenSSL
library. If you use Tor on Linux / Unix and you&#39;re getting SSL
renegotiation errors, upgrading should help. We also recommend an
upgrade if you&#39;re an exit relay.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.21 - 2009-12-21
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Work around a security feature in OpenSSL 0.9.8l that prevents our
handshake from working unless we explicitly tell OpenSSL that we
are using SSL renegotiation safely. We are, of course, but OpenSSL
0.9.8l won&#39;t work unless we say we are.</li>
<li>Avoid crashing if the client is trying to upload many bytes and the
circuit gets torn down at the same time, or if the flip side
happens on the exit relay. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 1150.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do not refuse to learn about authority certs and v2 networkstatus
documents that are older than the latest consensus. This bug might
have degraded client bootstrapping. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
Spotted and fixed by xmux.</li>
<li>Fix a couple of very-hard-to-trigger memory leaks, and one hard-to-
trigger platform-specific option misparsing case found by Coverity
Scan.</li>
<li>Fix a compilation warning on Fedora 12 by removing an impossible-to-
trigger assert. Fixes bug 1173.</li>
</ul>

          <p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">Bridge nodes</a> are one of Tor&#39;s key architectural components for allowing wide access to the network. These act like normal Tor nodes, except there is no centralized list available to download, so it&#39;s harder to block access to all of them. Users who cannot access the Tor network in the normal way can find the IP addresses of a few bridges, and connect to the rest of the Tor network via these nodes. The bridge node IP addresses are distributed in a way such that anyone should be able to find a few, but it should be difficult for someone to find (and block access to) them all. Currently they are available by email or the web, but more strategies are being considered, such as instant messaging or MMORPGs.</p>

<p>For the bridge system to work well, Tor needs lots of volunteers to run bridge nodes, as otherwise there would be so few that they could all be easily discovered and blocked. To increase the number of such nodes, it has been made easy to set up a bridge, just by clicking the &quot;Help censored users reach the Tor network&quot; in the Vidalia preferences. More could be done however. For example, the default Tor configuration could be set to make Tor clients automatically a bridge if they are reachable from the Internet and sufficiently reliable.</p>

<p>A positive aspect of this approach is that there would be vastly more bridges, improving both accessibility and performance of the Tor network. It may also improve the security of Tor clients which act as bridges. For example, doing so gives the client plausible deniability – traffic coming from a Tor node might be generated by the node operator, but it might be from somewhere else. There may be however other ways in which it could harm security.</p>

<p>This was the subject of a recent paper, presented at the 2009 <a href="http://wpes09.unibg.it/">Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society</a> by Jon McLachlan and Nicholas Hopper &quot; <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ehopper/surf_and_serve.pdf">On the risks of serving whenever you surf</a>&quot;. This paper presented a potential attack, which made use of three aspects of Tor&#39;s bridge architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>By making use of a set of proxy servers, including Tor itself, it is possible to find quite a large number of bridge IP addresses</li>
<li>It is possible to probe when a bridge node (and thus the user&#39;s PC) is running</li>
<li>Traffic flows going through a Tor node affect each other – a high bandwidth flow will cause others to slow down.</li>
</ul>

<p>By combining these aspects, the authors suggest that it might be possible to de-anonymize a pseudonymous Tor user who is also running a bridge. The basic technique is to find a list of candidate IP addresses, by trying to find as many bridge IP addresses as possible (the authors found about 3% in their tests). Then, over a few weeks or months, the attacker monitors what the pseudonymous Tor user is doing (e.g. blogging), and simultaneously whether the bridge nodes are running. If the user does something, and a bridge node is down, then clearly that bridge does not belong to the user. Eventually there are only a few candidate IP addresses left, and so the attack moves to the next stage.</p>

<p>Here, the attacker uses a variant of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Esjm217/papers/#pub-oakland05torta">clogging attack</a>, in which the performance of a Tor node is monitored, while the pseudonymous Tor user is sent lots of data. If the performance of the node drops dramatically, at exactly the same time that the pseudonymous Tor user is being attacked, then it is likely that node is on the path in use. In this way, the candidate IP addresses can be trimmed down leaving one or very few nodes which are likely that of the Tor user being attacked.</p>

<p>There are a few ways in which Tor users can defend against this attack, and the authors of the paper suggest a few modifications to Tor which do improve the situation. In addition, bridge node operators can defend themselves by leaving their node running even when they are not using it for anonymous browsing. The attack also relies on being able to track a user over a long period of time, so long-term pseudonyms are problematic (for other reasons too). In the specific case of blogging, one good idea is to <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/#timestamp">post entries with a random delay</a>, to hide exactly when they were published, as suggested by Global Voices.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ehopper/surf_and_serve.pdf">paper</a> goes into much more detail than covered in this blog post, so do read it if you would like to find out more about how precisely how the experiments were performed. For example, the experiments perform the clogging attack on nodes with fast network connections and comparatively slow CPUs, and their proposed defence makes this assumption. In the case of many bridge nodes, for example on domestic DSL lines, the situation could be very different, and variants of the attack might circumvent their protection. While this paper is an excellent start, there is much more that can be done in analyzing and defending against these style of attacks.</p>
