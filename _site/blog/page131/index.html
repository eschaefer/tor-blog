<p>Tor 0.2.0.31 addresses two potential anonymity issues, starts to fix
a big bug we&#39;re seeing where in rare cases traffic from one Tor stream
gets mixed into another stream, and fixes a variety of smaller issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html">https://www.torproject.org/download.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.31 - 2008-09-03
 o Major bugfixes:
 - Make sure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection
 with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This
 is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc.
 - Relays now reject risky extend cells: if the extend cell includes
 a digest of all zeroes, or asks to extend back to the relay that
 sent the extend cell, tear down the circuit. Ideas suggested
 by rovv.
 - If not enough of our entry guards are available so we add a new
 one, we might use the new one even if it overlapped with the
 current circuit&#39;s exit relay (or its family). Anonymity bugfix
 pointed out by rovv.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:
 - Recover 3-7 bytes that were wasted per memory chunk. Fixes bug
 794; bug spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
 - Correctly detect the presence of the linux/netfilter_ipv4.h header
 when building against recent kernels. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
 - Pick size of default geoip filename string correctly on windows.
 Fixes bug 806. Bugfix on 0.2.0.30.
 - Make the autoconf script accept the obsolete --with-ssl-dir
 option as an alias for the actually-working --with-openssl-dir
 option. Fix the help documentation to recommend --with-openssl-dir.
 Based on a patch by &quot;Dave&quot;. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
 - Disallow session resumption attempts during the renegotiation
 stage of the v2 handshake protocol. Clients should never be trying
 session resumption at this point, but apparently some did, in
 ways that caused the handshake to fail. Bug found by Geoff Goodell.
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.
 - When using the TransPort option on OpenBSD, and using the User
 option to change UID and drop privileges, make sure to open
 /dev/pf before dropping privileges. Fixes bug 782. Patch from
 Christopher Davis. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
 - Try to attach connections immediately upon receiving a RENDEZVOUS2
 or RENDEZVOUS_ESTABLISHED cell. This can save a second or two
 on the client side when connecting to a hidden service. Bugfix
 on 0.0.6pre1. Found and fixed by Christian Wilms; resolves bug 743.
 - When closing an application-side connection because its circuit is
 getting torn down, generate the stream event correctly. Bugfix on
 0.1.2.x. Anonymous patch.</p>

	      <p>Tor 0.2.0.30 is released. A better formatted version of this report can be found <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.onion-routing.announce/21">at gmane.org</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.30 switches to a more efficient directory distribution design,
adds features to make connections to the Tor network harder to block,
allows Tor to act as a DNS proxy, adds separate rate limiting for relayed
traffic to make it easier for clients to become relays, fixes a variety
of potential anonymity problems, and includes the usual huge pile of
other features and bug fixes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html">https://www.torproject.org/download.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.30 - 2008-07-15
 o New v3 directory design:
 - Tor now uses a new way to learn about and distribute information
 about the network: the directory authorities vote on a common
 network status document rather than each publishing their own
 opinion. Now clients and caches download only one networkstatus
 document to bootstrap, rather than downloading one for each
 authority. Clients only download router descriptors listed in
 the consensus. Implements proposal 101; see doc/spec/dir-spec.txt
 for details.
 - Set up moria1, tor26, and dizum as v3 directory authorities
 in addition to being v2 authorities. Also add three new ones:
 ides (run by Mike Perry), gabelmoo (run by Karsten Loesing), and
 dannenberg (run by CCC).
 - Switch to multi-level keys for directory authorities: now their
 long-term identity key can be kept offline, and they periodically
 generate a new signing key. Clients fetch the &quot;key certificates&quot;
 to keep up to date on the right keys. Add a standalone tool
 &quot;tor-gencert&quot; to generate key certificates. Implements proposal 103.
 - Add a new V3AuthUseLegacyKey config option to make it easier for
 v3 authorities to change their identity keys if another bug like
 Debian&#39;s OpenSSL RNG flaw appears.
 - Authorities and caches fetch the v2 networkstatus documents
 less often, now that v3 is recommended.</p>

<p>o Make Tor connections stand out less on the wire:
 - Use an improved TLS handshake designed by Steven Murdoch in proposal
 124, as revised in proposal 130. The new handshake is meant to
 be harder for censors to fingerprint, and it adds the ability
 to detect certain kinds of man-in-the-middle traffic analysis
 attacks. The new handshake format includes version negotiation for
 OR connections as described in proposal 105, which will allow us
 to improve Tor&#39;s link protocol more safely in the future.
 - Enable encrypted directory connections by default for non-relays,
 so censor tools that block Tor directory connections based on their
 plaintext patterns will no longer work. This means Tor works in
 certain censored countries by default again.
 - Stop including recognizeable strings in the commonname part of
 Tor&#39;s x509 certificates.</p>

<p>o Implement bridge relays:
 - Bridge relays (or &quot;bridges&quot; for short) are Tor relays that aren&#39;t
 listed in the main Tor directory. Since there is no complete public
 list of them, even an ISP that is filtering connections to all the
 known Tor relays probably won&#39;t be able to block all the bridges.
 See doc/design-paper/blocking.pdf and proposal 125 for details.
 - New config option BridgeRelay that specifies you want to be a
 bridge relay rather than a normal relay. When BridgeRelay is set
 to 1, then a) you cache dir info even if your DirPort ins&#39;t on,
 and b) the default for PublishServerDescriptor is now &quot;bridge&quot;
 rather than &quot;v2,v3&quot;.
 - New config option &quot;UseBridges 1&quot; for clients that want to use bridge
 relays instead of ordinary entry guards. Clients then specify
 bridge relays by adding &quot;Bridge&quot; lines to their config file. Users
 can learn about a bridge relay either manually through word of
 mouth, or by one of our rate-limited mechanisms for giving out
 bridge addresses without letting an attacker easily enumerate them
 all. See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges" title="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">https://www.torproject.org/bridges</a> for details.
 - Bridge relays behave like clients with respect to time intervals
 for downloading new v3 consensus documents -- otherwise they
 stand out. Bridge users now wait until the end of the interval,
 so their bridge relay will be sure to have a new consensus document.</p>

<p>o Implement bridge directory authorities:
 - Bridge authorities are like normal directory authorities, except
 they don&#39;t serve a list of known bridges. Therefore users that know
 a bridge&#39;s fingerprint can fetch a relay descriptor for that bridge,
 including fetching updates e.g. if the bridge changes IP address,
 yet an attacker can&#39;t just fetch a list of all the bridges.
 - Set up Tonga as the default bridge directory authority.
 - Bridge authorities refuse to serve bridge descriptors or other
 bridge information over unencrypted connections (that is, when
 responding to direct DirPort requests rather than begin_dir cells.)
 - Bridge directory authorities do reachability testing on the
 bridges they know. They provide router status summaries to the
 controller via &quot;getinfo ns/purpose/bridge&quot;, and also dump summaries
 to a file periodically, so we can keep internal stats about which
 bridges are functioning.
 - If bridge users set the UpdateBridgesFromAuthority config option,
 but the digest they ask for is a 404 on the bridge authority,
 they fall back to contacting the bridge directly.
 - Bridges always use begin_dir to publish their server descriptor to
 the bridge authority using an anonymous encrypted tunnel.
 - Early work on a &quot;bridge community&quot; design: if bridge authorities set
 the BridgePassword config option, they will serve a snapshot of
 known bridge routerstatuses from their DirPort to anybody who
 knows that password. Unset by default.
 - Tor now includes an IP-to-country GeoIP file, so bridge relays can
 report sanitized aggregated summaries in their extra-info documents
 privately to the bridge authority, listing which countries are
 able to reach them. We hope this mechanism will let us learn when
 certain countries start trying to block bridges.
 - Bridge authorities write bridge descriptors to disk, so they can
 reload them after a reboot. They can also export the descriptors
 to other programs, so we can distribute them to blocked users via
 the BridgeDB interface, e.g. via <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/" title="https://bridges.torproject.org/">https://bridges.torproject.org/</a>
 and bridges torproject.org.</p>

<p>o Tor can be a DNS proxy:
 - The new client-side DNS proxy feature replaces the need for
 dns-proxy-tor: Just set &quot;DNSPort 9999&quot;, and Tor will now listen
 for DNS requests on port 9999, use the Tor network to resolve them
 anonymously, and send the reply back like a regular DNS server.
 The code still only implements a subset of DNS.
 - Add a new AutomapHostsOnResolve option: when it is enabled, any
 resolve request for hosts matching a given pattern causes Tor to
 generate an internal virtual address mapping for that host. This
 allows DNSPort to work sensibly with hidden service users. By
 default, .exit and .onion addresses are remapped; the list of
 patterns can be reconfigured with AutomapHostsSuffixes.
 - Add an &quot;-F&quot; option to tor-resolve to force a resolve for a .onion
 address. Thanks to the AutomapHostsOnResolve option, this is no
 longer a completely silly thing to do.</p>

<p>o Major features (relay usability):
 - New config options RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst:
 a separate set of token buckets for relayed traffic. Right now
 relayed traffic is defined as answers to directory requests, and
 OR connections that don&#39;t have any local circuits on them. See
 proposal 111 for details.
 - Create listener connections before we setuid to the configured
 User and Group. Now non-Windows users can choose port values
 under 1024, start Tor as root, and have Tor bind those ports
 before it changes to another UID. (Windows users could already
 pick these ports.)
 - Added a new ConstrainedSockets config option to set SO_SNDBUF and
 SO_RCVBUF on TCP sockets. Hopefully useful for Tor servers running
 on &quot;vserver&quot; accounts. Patch from coderman.</p>

<p>o Major features (directory authorities):
 - Directory authorities track weighted fractional uptime and weighted
 mean-time-between failures for relays. WFU is suitable for deciding
 whether a node is &quot;usually up&quot;, while MTBF is suitable for deciding
 whether a node is &quot;likely to stay up.&quot; We need both, because
 &quot;usually up&quot; is a good requirement for guards, while &quot;likely to
 stay up&quot; is a good requirement for long-lived connections.
 - Directory authorities use a new formula for selecting which relays
 to advertise as Guards: they must be in the top 7/8 in terms of
 how long we have known about them, and above the median of those
 nodes in terms of weighted fractional uptime.
 - Directory authorities use a new formula for selecting which relays
 to advertise as Stable: when we have 4 or more days of data, use
 median measured MTBF rather than median declared uptime. Implements
 proposal 108.
 - Directory authorities accept and serve &quot;extra info&quot; documents for
 routers. Routers now publish their bandwidth-history lines in the
 extra-info docs rather than the main descriptor. This step saves
 60% (!) on compressed router descriptor downloads. Servers upload
 extra-info docs to any authority that accepts them; directory
 authorities now allow multiple router descriptors and/or extra
 info documents to be uploaded in a single go. Authorities, and
 caches that have been configured to download extra-info documents,
 download them as needed. Implements proposal 104.
 - Authorities now list relays who have the same nickname as
 a different named relay, but list them with a new flag:
 &quot;Unnamed&quot;. Now we can make use of relays that happen to pick the
 same nickname as a server that registered two years ago and then
 disappeared. Implements proposal 122.
 - Store routers in a file called cached-descriptors instead of in
 cached-routers. Initialize cached-descriptors from cached-routers
 if the old format is around. The new format allows us to store
 annotations along with descriptors, to record the time we received
 each descriptor, its source, and its purpose: currently one of
 general, controller, or bridge.</p>

<p>o Major features (other):
 - New config options WarnPlaintextPorts and RejectPlaintextPorts so
 Tor can warn and/or refuse connections to ports commonly used with
 vulnerable-plaintext protocols. Currently we warn on ports 23,
 109, 110, and 143, but we don&#39;t reject any. Based on proposal 129
 by Kevin Bauer and Damon McCoy.
 - Integrate Karsten Loesing&#39;s Google Summer of Code project to publish
 hidden service descriptors on a set of redundant relays that are a
 function of the hidden service address. Now we don&#39;t have to rely
 on three central hidden service authorities for publishing and
 fetching every hidden service descriptor. Implements proposal 114.
 - Allow tunnelled directory connections to ask for an encrypted
 &quot;begin_dir&quot; connection or an anonymized &quot;uses a full Tor circuit&quot;
 connection independently. Now we can make anonymized begin_dir
 connections for (e.g.) more secure hidden service posting and
 fetching.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (crashes and assert failures):
 - Stop imposing an arbitrary maximum on the number of file descriptors
 used for busy servers. Bug reported by Olaf Selke; patch from
 Sebastian Hahn.
 - Avoid possible failures when generating a directory with routers
 with over-long versions strings, or too many flags set.
 - Fix a rare assert error when we&#39;re closing one of our threads:
 use a mutex to protect the list of logs, so we never write to the
 list as it&#39;s being freed. Fixes the very rare bug 575, which is
 kind of the revenge of bug 222.
 - Avoid segfault in the case where a badly behaved v2 versioning
 directory sends a signed networkstatus with missing client-versions.
 - When we hit an EOF on a log (probably because we&#39;re shutting down),
 don&#39;t try to remove the log from the list: just mark it as
 unusable. (Bulletproofs against bug 222.)</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (code security fixes):
 - Detect size overflow in zlib code. Reported by Justin Ferguson and
 Dan Kaminsky.
 - Rewrite directory tokenization code to never run off the end of
 a string. Fixes bug 455. Patch from croup.
 - Be more paranoid about overwriting sensitive memory on free(),
 as a defensive programming tactic to ensure forward secrecy.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (anonymity fixes):
 - Reject requests for reverse-dns lookup of names that are in
 a private address space. Patch from lodger.
 - Never report that we&#39;ve used more bandwidth than we&#39;re willing to
 relay: it leaks how much non-relay traffic we&#39;re using. Resolves
 bug 516.
 - As a client, do not believe any server that tells us that an
 address maps to an internal address space.
 - Warn about unsafe ControlPort configurations.
 - Directory authorities now call routers Fast if their bandwidth is
 at least 100KB/s, and consider their bandwidth adequate to be a
 Guard if it is at least 250KB/s, no matter the medians. This fix
 complements proposal 107.
 - Directory authorities now never mark more than 2 servers per IP as
 Valid and Running (or 5 on addresses shared by authorities).
 Implements proposal 109, by Kevin Bauer and Damon McCoy.
 - If we&#39;re a relay, avoid picking ourselves as an introduction point,
 a rendezvous point, or as the final hop for internal circuits. Bug
 reported by taranis and lodger.
 - Exit relays that are used as a client can now reach themselves
 using the .exit notation, rather than just launching an infinite
 pile of circuits. Fixes bug 641. Reported by Sebastian Hahn.
 - Fix a bug where, when we were choosing the &#39;end stream reason&#39; to
 put in our relay end cell that we send to the exit relay, Tor
 clients on Windows were sometimes sending the wrong &#39;reason&#39;. The
 anonymity problem is that exit relays may be able to guess whether
 the client is running Windows, thus helping partition the anonymity
 set. Down the road we should stop sending reasons to exit relays,
 or otherwise prevent future versions of this bug.
 - Only update guard status (usable / not usable) once we have
 enough directory information. This was causing us to discard all our
 guards on startup if we hadn&#39;t been running for a few weeks. Fixes
 bug 448.
 - When our directory information has been expired for a while, stop
 being willing to build circuits using it. Fixes bug 401.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (peace of mind for relay operators)
 - Non-exit relays no longer answer &quot;resolve&quot; relay cells, so they
 can&#39;t be induced to do arbitrary DNS requests. (Tor clients already
 avoid using non-exit relays for resolve cells, but now servers
 enforce this too.) Fixes bug 619. Patch from lodger.
 - When we setconf ClientOnly to 1, close any current OR and Dir
 listeners. Reported by mwenge.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (other):
 - If we only ever used Tor for hidden service lookups or posts, we
 would stop building circuits and start refusing connections after
 24 hours, since we falsely believed that Tor was dormant. Reported
 by nwf.
 - Add a new __HashedControlSessionPassword option for controllers
 to use for one-off session password hashes that shouldn&#39;t get
 saved to disk by SAVECONF --- Vidalia users were accumulating a
 pile of HashedControlPassword lines in their torrc files, one for
 each time they had restarted Tor and then clicked Save. Make Tor
 automatically convert &quot;HashedControlPassword&quot; to this new option but
 only when it&#39;s given on the command line. Partial fix for bug 586.
 - Patch from &quot;Andrew S. Lists&quot; to catch when we contact a directory
 mirror at IP address X and he says we look like we&#39;re coming from
 IP address X. Otherwise this would screw up our address detection.
 - Reject uploaded descriptors and extrainfo documents if they&#39;re
 huge. Otherwise we&#39;ll cache them all over the network and it&#39;ll
 clog everything up. Suggested by Aljosha Judmayer.
 - When a hidden service was trying to establish an introduction point,
 and Tor *did* manage to reuse one of the preemptively built
 circuits, it didn&#39;t correctly remember which one it used,
 so it asked for another one soon after, until there were no
 more preemptive circuits, at which point it launched one from
 scratch. Bugfix on 0.0.9.x.</p>

<p>o Rate limiting and load balancing improvements:
 - When we add data to a write buffer in response to the data on that
 write buffer getting low because of a flush, do not consider the
 newly added data as a candidate for immediate flushing, but rather
 make it wait until the next round of writing. Otherwise, we flush
 and refill recursively, and a single greedy TLS connection can
 eat all of our bandwidth.
 - When counting the number of bytes written on a TLS connection,
 look at the BIO actually used for writing to the network, not
 at the BIO used (sometimes) to buffer data for the network.
 Looking at different BIOs could result in write counts on the
 order of ULONG_MAX. Fixes bug 614.
 - If we change our MaxAdvertisedBandwidth and then reload torrc,
 Tor won&#39;t realize it should publish a new relay descriptor. Fixes
 bug 688, reported by mfr.
 - Avoid using too little bandwidth when our clock skips a few seconds.
 - Choose which bridge to use proportional to its advertised bandwidth,
 rather than uniformly at random. This should speed up Tor for
 bridge users. Also do this for people who set StrictEntryNodes.</p>

<p>o Bootstrapping faster and building circuits more intelligently:
 - Fix bug 660 that was preventing us from knowing that we should
 preemptively build circuits to handle expected directory requests.
 - When we&#39;re checking if we have enough dir info for each relay
 to begin establishing circuits, make sure that we actually have
 the descriptor listed in the consensus, not just any descriptor.
 - Correctly notify one-hop connections when a circuit build has
 failed. Possible fix for bug 669. Found by lodger.
 - Clients now hold circuitless TLS connections open for 1.5 times
 MaxCircuitDirtiness (15 minutes), since it is likely that they&#39;ll
 rebuild a new circuit over them within that timeframe. Previously,
 they held them open only for KeepalivePeriod (5 minutes).</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (memory):
 - Add OpenBSD malloc code from &quot;phk&quot; as an optional malloc
 replacement on Linux: some glibc libraries do very poorly with
 Tor&#39;s memory allocation patterns. Pass --enable-openbsd-malloc to
 ./configure to get the replacement malloc code.
 - Switch our old ring buffer implementation for one more like that
 used by free Unix kernels. The wasted space in a buffer with 1mb
 of data will now be more like 8k than 1mb. The new implementation
 also avoids realloc();realloc(); patterns that can contribute to
 memory fragmentation.
 - Change the way that Tor buffers data that it is waiting to write.
 Instead of queueing data cells in an enormous ring buffer for each
 client-&gt;OR or OR-&gt;OR connection, we now queue cells on a separate
 queue for each circuit. This lets us use less slack memory, and
 will eventually let us be smarter about prioritizing different kinds
 of traffic.
 - Reference-count and share copies of address policy entries; only 5%
 of them were actually distinct.
 - Tune parameters for cell pool allocation to minimize amount of
 RAM overhead used.
 - Keep unused 4k and 16k buffers on free lists, rather than wasting 8k
 for every single inactive connection_t. Free items from the
 4k/16k-buffer free lists when they haven&#39;t been used for a while.
 - Make memory debugging information describe more about history
 of cell allocation, so we can help reduce our memory use.
 - Be even more aggressive about releasing RAM from small
 empty buffers. Thanks to our free-list code, this shouldn&#39;t be too
 performance-intensive.
 - Log malloc statistics from mallinfo() on platforms where it exists.
 - Use memory pools to allocate cells with better speed and memory
 efficiency, especially on platforms where malloc() is inefficient.
 - Add a --with-tcmalloc option to the configure script to link
 against tcmalloc (if present). Does not yet search for non-system
 include paths.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (socket management):
 - Count the number of open sockets separately from the number of
 active connection_t objects. This will let us avoid underusing
 our allocated connection limit.
 - We no longer use socket pairs to link an edge connection to an
 anonymous directory connection or a DirPort test connection.
 Instead, we track the link internally and transfer the data
 in-process. This saves two sockets per &quot;linked&quot; connection (at the
 client and at the server), and avoids the nasty Windows socketpair()
 workaround.
 - We were leaking a file descriptor if Tor started with a zero-length
 cached-descriptors file. Patch by &quot;freddy77&quot;.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (CPU use):
 - Never walk through the list of logs if we know that no log target
 is interested in a given message.
 - Call routerlist_remove_old_routers() much less often. This should
 speed startup, especially on directory caches.
 - Base64 decoding was actually showing up on our profile when parsing
 the initial descriptor file; switch to an in-process all-at-once
 implementation that&#39;s about 3.5x times faster than calling out to
 OpenSSL.
 - Use a slightly simpler string hashing algorithm (copying Python&#39;s
 instead of Java&#39;s) and optimize our digest hashing algorithm to take
 advantage of 64-bit platforms and to remove some possibly-costly
 voodoo.
 - When implementing AES counter mode, update only the portions of the
 counter buffer that need to change, and don&#39;t keep separate
 network-order and host-order counters on big-endian hosts (where
 they are the same).
 - Add an in-place version of aes_crypt() so that we can avoid doing a
 needless memcpy() call on each cell payload.
 - Use Critical Sections rather than Mutexes for synchronizing threads
 on win32; Mutexes are heavier-weight, and designed for synchronizing
 between processes.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (bandwidth use):
 - Don&#39;t try to launch new descriptor downloads quite so often when we
 already have enough directory information to build circuits.
 - Version 1 directories are no longer generated in full. Instead,
 authorities generate and serve &quot;stub&quot; v1 directories that list
 no servers. This will stop Tor versions 0.1.0.x and earlier from
 working, but (for security reasons) nobody should be running those
 versions anyway.
 - Avoid going directly to the directory authorities even if you&#39;re a
 relay, if you haven&#39;t found yourself reachable yet or if you&#39;ve
 decided not to advertise your dirport yet. Addresses bug 556.
 - If we&#39;ve gone 12 hours since our last bandwidth check, and we
 estimate we have less than 50KB bandwidth capacity but we could
 handle more, do another bandwidth test.
 - Support &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; when answering HTTP requests for
 directories, running-routers documents, and v2 and v3 networkstatus
 documents. (There&#39;s no need to support it for router descriptors,
 since those are downloaded by descriptor digest.)
 - Stop fetching directory info so aggressively if your DirPort is
 on but your ORPort is off; stop fetching v2 dir info entirely.
 You can override these choices with the new FetchDirInfoEarly
 config option.</p>

<p>o Changed config option behavior (features):
 - Configuration files now accept C-style strings as values. This
 helps encode characters not allowed in the current configuration
 file format, such as newline or #. Addresses bug 557.
 - Add hidden services and DNSPorts to the list of things that make
 Tor accept that it has running ports. Change starting Tor with no
 ports from a fatal error to a warning; we might change it back if
 this turns out to confuse anybody. Fixes bug 579.
 - Make PublishServerDescriptor default to 1, so the default doesn&#39;t
 have to change as we invent new directory protocol versions.
 - Allow people to say PreferTunnelledDirConns rather than
 PreferTunneledDirConns, for those alternate-spellers out there.
 - Raise the default BandwidthRate/BandwidthBurst to 5MB/10MB, to
 accommodate the growing number of servers that use the default
 and are reaching it.
 - Make it possible to enable HashedControlPassword and
 CookieAuthentication at the same time.
 - When a TrackHostExits-chosen exit fails too many times in a row,
 stop using it. Fixes bug 437.</p>

<p>o Changed config option behavior (bugfixes):
 - Do not read the configuration file when we&#39;ve only been told to
 generate a password hash. Fixes bug 643. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5. Fix
 based on patch from Sebastian Hahn.
 - Actually validate the options passed to AuthDirReject,
 AuthDirInvalid, AuthDirBadDir, and AuthDirBadExit.
 - Make &quot;ClientOnly 1&quot; config option disable directory ports too.
 - Don&#39;t stop fetching descriptors when FetchUselessDescriptors is
 set, even if we stop asking for circuits. Bug reported by tup
 and ioerror.
 - Servers used to decline to publish their DirPort if their
 BandwidthRate or MaxAdvertisedBandwidth were below a threshold. Now
 they look only at BandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthRate.
 - Treat &quot;2gb&quot; when given in torrc for a bandwidth as meaning 2gb,
 minus 1 byte: the actual maximum declared bandwidth.
 - Make &quot;TrackHostExits .&quot; actually work. Bugfix on 0.1.0.x.
 - Make the NodeFamilies config option work. (Reported by
 lodger -- it has never actually worked, even though we added it
 in Oct 2004.)
 - If Tor is invoked from something that isn&#39;t a shell (e.g. Vidalia),
 now we expand &quot;-f ~/.tor/torrc&quot; correctly. Suggested by Matt Edman.</p>

<p>o New config options:
 - New configuration options AuthDirMaxServersPerAddr and
 AuthDirMaxServersperAuthAddr to override default maximum number
 of servers allowed on a single IP address. This is important for
 running a test network on a single host.
 - Three new config options (AlternateDirAuthority,
 AlternateBridgeAuthority, and AlternateHSAuthority) that let the
 user selectively replace the default directory authorities by type,
 rather than the all-or-nothing replacement that DirServer offers.
 - New config options AuthDirBadDir and AuthDirListBadDirs for
 authorities to mark certain relays as &quot;bad directories&quot; in the
 networkstatus documents. Also supports the &quot;!baddir&quot; directive in
 the approved-routers file.
 - New config option V2AuthoritativeDirectory that all v2 directory
 authorities must set. This lets v3 authorities choose not to serve
 v2 directory information.</p>

<p>o Minor features (other):
 - When we&#39;re not serving v2 directory information, there is no reason
 to actually keep any around. Remove the obsolete files and directory
 on startup if they are very old and we aren&#39;t going to serve them.
 - When we negotiate a v2 link-layer connection (not yet implemented),
 accept RELAY_EARLY cells and turn them into RELAY cells if we&#39;ve
 negotiated a v1 connection for their next step. Initial steps for
 proposal 110.
 - When we have no consensus, check FallbackNetworkstatusFile (defaults
 to $PREFIX/share/tor/fallback-consensus) for a consensus. This way
 we can start out knowing some directory caches. We don&#39;t ship with
 a fallback consensus by default though, because it was making
 bootstrapping take too long while we tried many down relays.
 - Authorities send back an X-Descriptor-Not-New header in response to
 an accepted-but-discarded descriptor upload. Partially implements
 fix for bug 535.
 - If we find a cached-routers file that&#39;s been sitting around for more
 than 28 days unmodified, then most likely it&#39;s a leftover from
 when we upgraded to 0.2.0.8-alpha. Remove it. It has no good
 routers anyway.
 - When we (as a cache) download a descriptor because it was listed
 in a consensus, remember when the consensus was supposed to expire,
 and don&#39;t expire the descriptor until then.
 - Optionally (if built with -DEXPORTMALLINFO) export the output
 of mallinfo via http, as tor/mallinfo.txt. Only accessible
 from localhost.
 - Tag every guard node in our state file with the version that
 we believe added it, or with our own version if we add it. This way,
 if a user temporarily runs an old version of Tor and then switches
 back to a new one, she doesn&#39;t automatically lose her guards.
 - When somebody requests a list of statuses or servers, and we have
 none of those, return a 404 rather than an empty 200.
 - Merge in some (as-yet-unused) IPv6 address manipulation code. (Patch
 from croup.)
 - Add an HSAuthorityRecordStats option that hidden service authorities
 can use to track statistics of overall hidden service usage without
 logging information that would be as useful to an attacker.
 - Allow multiple HiddenServicePort directives with the same virtual
 port; when they occur, the user is sent round-robin to one
 of the target ports chosen at random. Partially fixes bug 393 by
 adding limited ad-hoc round-robining.
 - Revamp file-writing logic so we don&#39;t need to have the entire
 contents of a file in memory at once before we write to disk. Tor,
 meet stdio.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (other):
 - Alter the code that tries to recover from unhandled write
 errors, to not try to flush onto a socket that&#39;s given us
 unhandled errors.
 - Directory mirrors no longer include a guess at the client&#39;s IP
 address if the connection appears to be coming from the same /24
 network; it was producing too many wrong guesses.
 - If we&#39;re trying to flush the last bytes on a connection (for
 example, when answering a directory request), reset the
 time-to-give-up timeout every time we manage to write something
 on the socket.
 - Reject router descriptors with out-of-range bandwidthcapacity or
 bandwidthburst values.
 - If we can&#39;t expand our list of entry guards (e.g. because we&#39;re
 using bridges or we have StrictEntryNodes set), don&#39;t mark relays
 down when they fail a directory request. Otherwise we&#39;re too quick
 to mark all our entry points down.
 - Authorities no longer send back &quot;400 you&#39;re unreachable please fix
 it&quot; errors to Tor servers that aren&#39;t online all the time. We&#39;re
 supposed to tolerate these servers now.
 - Let directory authorities startup even when they can&#39;t generate
 a descriptor immediately, e.g. because they don&#39;t know their
 address.
 - Correctly enforce that elements of directory objects do not appear
 more often than they are allowed to appear.
 - Stop allowing hibernating servers to be &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;.
 - On Windows, we were preventing other processes from reading
 cached-routers while Tor was running. (Reported by janbar)
 - Check return values from pthread_mutex functions.
 - When opening /dev/null in finish_daemonize(), do not pass the
 O_CREAT flag. Fortify was complaining, and correctly so. Fixes
 bug 742; fix from Michael Scherer. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre19.</p>

<p>o Controller features:
 - The GETCONF command now escapes and quotes configuration values
 that don&#39;t otherwise fit into the torrc file.
 - The SETCONF command now handles quoted values correctly.
 - Add &quot;GETINFO/desc-annotations/id/≤OR digest&gt;&quot; so controllers can
 ask about source, timestamp of arrival, purpose, etc. We need
 something like this to help Vidalia not do GeoIP lookups on bridge
 addresses.
 - Allow multiple HashedControlPassword config lines, to support
 multiple controller passwords.
 - Accept LF instead of CRLF on controller, since some software has a
 hard time generating real Internet newlines.
 - Add GETINFO values for the server status events
 &quot;REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED&quot; and &quot;GOOD_SERVER_DESCRIPTOR&quot;. Patch from
 Robert Hogan.
 - There is now an ugly, temporary &quot;desc/all-recent-extrainfo-hack&quot;
 GETINFO for Torstat to use until it can switch to using extrainfos.
 - New config option CookieAuthFile to choose a new location for the
 cookie authentication file, and config option
 CookieAuthFileGroupReadable to make it group-readable.
 - Add a SOURCE_ADDR field to STREAM NEW events so that controllers can
 match requests to applications. Patch from Robert Hogan.
 - Add a RESOLVE command to launch hostname lookups. Original patch
 from Robert Hogan.
 - Add GETINFO status/enough-dir-info to let controllers tell whether
 Tor has downloaded sufficient directory information. Patch from Tup.
 - You can now use the ControlSocket option to tell Tor to listen for
 controller connections on Unix domain sockets on systems that
 support them. Patch from Peter Palfrader.
 - New &quot;GETINFO address-mappings/*&quot; command to get address mappings
 with expiry information. &quot;addr-mappings/*&quot; is now deprecated.
 Patch from Tup.
 - Add a new config option __DisablePredictedCircuits designed for
 use by the controller, when we don&#39;t want Tor to build any circuits
 preemptively.
 - Let the controller specify HOP=%d as an argument to ATTACHSTREAM,
 so we can exit from the middle of the circuit.
 - Implement &quot;getinfo status/circuit-established&quot;.
 - Implement &quot;getinfo status/version/...&quot; so a controller can tell
 whether the current version is recommended, and whether any versions
 are good, and how many authorities agree. Patch from &quot;shibz&quot;.
 - Controllers should now specify cache=no or cache=yes when using
 the +POSTDESCRIPTOR command.
 - Add a &quot;PURPOSE=&quot; argument to &quot;STREAM NEW&quot; events, as suggested by
 Robert Hogan. Fixes the first part of bug 681.
 - When reporting clock skew, and we know that the clock is _at least
 as skewed_ as some value, but we don&#39;t know the actual value,
 report the value as a &quot;minimum skew.&quot;</p>

<p>o Controller bugfixes:
 - Generate &quot;STATUS_SERVER&quot; events rather than misspelled
 &quot;STATUS_SEVER&quot; events. Caught by mwenge.
 - Reject controller commands over 1MB in length, so rogue
 processes can&#39;t run us out of memory.
 - Change the behavior of &quot;getinfo status/good-server-descriptor&quot;
 so it doesn&#39;t return failure when any authority disappears.
 - Send NAMESERVER_STATUS messages for a single failed nameserver
 correctly.
 - When the DANGEROUS_VERSION controller status event told us we&#39;re
 running an obsolete version, it used the string &quot;OLD&quot; to describe
 it. Yet the &quot;getinfo&quot; interface used the string &quot;OBSOLETE&quot;. Now use
 &quot;OBSOLETE&quot; in both cases.
 - Respond to INT and TERM SIGNAL commands before we execute the
 signal, in case the signal shuts us down. We had a patch in
 0.1.2.1-alpha that tried to do this by queueing the response on
 the connection&#39;s buffer before shutting down, but that really
 isn&#39;t the same thing at all. Bug located by Matt Edman.
 - Provide DNS expiry times in GMT, not in local time. For backward
 compatibility, ADDRMAP events only provide GMT expiry in an extended
 field. &quot;GETINFO address-mappings&quot; always does the right thing.
 - Use CRLF line endings properly in NS events.
 - Make &#39;getinfo fingerprint&#39; return a 551 error if we&#39;re not a
 server, so we match what the control spec claims we do. Reported
 by daejees.
 - Fix a typo in an error message when extendcircuit fails that
 caused us to not follow the \r\n-based delimiter protocol. Reported
 by daejees.
 - When tunneling an encrypted directory connection, and its first
 circuit fails, do not leave it unattached and ask the controller
 to deal. Fixes the second part of bug 681.
 - Treat some 403 responses from directory servers as INFO rather than
 WARN-severity events.</p>

<p>o Portability / building / compiling:
 - When building with --enable-gcc-warnings, check for whether Apple&#39;s
 warning &quot;-Wshorten-64-to-32&quot; is available.
 - Support compilation to target iPhone; patch from cjacker huang.
 To build for iPhone, pass the --enable-iphone option to configure.
 - Detect non-ASCII platforms (if any still exist) and refuse to
 build there: some of our code assumes that &#39;A&#39; is 65 and so on.
 - Clear up some MIPSPro compiler warnings.
 - Make autoconf search for libevent, openssl, and zlib consistently.
 - Update deprecated macros in configure.in.
 - When warning about missing headers, tell the user to let us
 know if the compile succeeds anyway, so we can downgrade the
 warning.
 - Include the current subversion revision as part of the version
 string: either fetch it directly if we&#39;re in an SVN checkout, do
 some magic to guess it if we&#39;re in an SVK checkout, or use
 the last-detected version if we&#39;re building from a .tar.gz.
 Use this version consistently in log messages.
 - Correctly report platform name on Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 SE.
 - Read resolv.conf files correctly on platforms where read() returns
 partial results on small file reads.
 - Build without verbose warnings even on gcc 4.2 and 4.3.
 - On Windows, correctly detect errors when listing the contents of
 a directory. Fix from lodger.
 - Run &#39;make test&#39; as part of &#39;make dist&#39;, so we stop releasing so
 many development snapshots that fail their unit tests.
 - Add support to detect Libevent versions in the 1.4.x series
 on mingw.
 - Add command-line arguments to unit-test executable so that we can
 invoke any chosen test from the command line rather than having
 to run the whole test suite at once; and so that we can turn on
 logging for the unit tests.
 - Do not automatically run configure from autogen.sh. This
 non-standard behavior tended to annoy people who have built other
 programs.
 - Fix a macro/CPP interaction that was confusing some compilers:
 some GCCs don&#39;t like #if/#endif pairs inside macro arguments.
 Fixes bug 707.
 - Fix macro collision between OpenSSL 0.9.8h and Windows headers.
 Fixes bug 704; fix from Steven Murdoch.
 - Correctly detect transparent proxy support on Linux hosts that
 require in.h to be included before netfilter_ipv4.h. Patch
 from coderman.</p>

<p>o Logging improvements:
 - When we haven&#39;t had any application requests lately, don&#39;t bother
 logging that we have expired a bunch of descriptors.
 - When attempting to open a logfile fails, tell us why.
 - Only log guard node status when guard node status has changed.
 - Downgrade the 3 most common &quot;INFO&quot; messages to &quot;DEBUG&quot;. This will
 make &quot;INFO&quot; 75% less verbose.
 - When SafeLogging is disabled, log addresses along with all TLS
 errors.
 - Report TLS &quot;zero return&quot; case as a &quot;clean close&quot; and &quot;IO error&quot;
 as a &quot;close&quot;. Stop calling closes &quot;unexpected closes&quot;: existing
 Tors don&#39;t use SSL_close(), so having a connection close without
 the TLS shutdown handshake is hardly unexpected.
 - When we receive a consensus from the future, warn about skew.
 - Make &quot;not enough dir info yet&quot; warnings describe *why* Tor feels
 it doesn&#39;t have enough directory info yet.
 - On the USR1 signal, when dmalloc is in use, log the top 10 memory
 consumers. (We already do this on HUP.)
 - Give more descriptive well-formedness errors for out-of-range
 hidden service descriptor/protocol versions.
 - Stop recommending that every server operator send mail to tor-ops.
 Resolves bug 597. Bugfix on 0.1.2.x.
 - Improve skew reporting: try to give the user a better log message
 about how skewed they are, and how much this matters.
 - New --quiet command-line option to suppress the default console log.
 Good in combination with --hash-password.
 - Don&#39;t complain that &quot;your server has not managed to confirm that its
 ports are reachable&quot; if we haven&#39;t been able to build any circuits
 yet.
 - Detect the reason for failing to mmap a descriptor file we just
 wrote, and give a more useful log message. Fixes bug 533.
 - Always prepend &quot;Bug: &quot; to any log message about a bug.
 - When dumping memory usage, list bytes used in buffer memory
 free-lists.
 - When running with dmalloc, dump more stats on hup and on exit.
 - Put a platform string (e.g. &quot;Linux i686&quot;) in the startup log
 message, so when people paste just their logs, we know if it&#39;s
 OpenBSD or Windows or what.
 - When logging memory usage, break down memory used in buffers by
 buffer type.
 - When we are reporting the DirServer line we just parsed, we were
 logging the second stanza of the key fingerprint, not the first.
 - Even though Windows is equally happy with / and \ as path separators,
 try to use \ consistently on Windows and / consistently on Unix: it
 makes the log messages nicer.
 - On OSX, stop warning the user that kqueue support in libevent is
 &quot;experimental&quot;, since it seems to have worked fine for ages.</p>

<p>o Contributed scripts and tools:
 - Update linux-tor-prio.sh script to allow QoS based on the uid of
 the Tor process. Patch from Marco Bonetti with tweaks from Mike
 Perry.
 - Include the &quot;tor-ctrl.sh&quot; bash script by Stefan Behte to provide
 Unix users an easy way to script their Tor process (e.g. by
 adjusting bandwidth based on the time of the day).
 - In the exitlist script, only consider the most recently published
 server descriptor for each server. Also, when the user requests
 a list of servers that _reject_ connections to a given address,
 explicitly exclude the IPs that also have servers that accept
 connections to that address. Resolves bug 405.
 - Include a new contrib/tor-exit-notice.html file that exit relay
 operators can put on their website to help reduce abuse queries.</p>

<p>o Newly deprecated features:
 - The status/version/num-versioning and status/version/num-concurring
 GETINFO controller options are no longer useful in the v3 directory
 protocol: treat them as deprecated, and warn when they&#39;re used.
 - The RedirectExits config option is now deprecated.</p>

<p>o Removed features:
 - Drop the old code to choke directory connections when the
 corresponding OR connections got full: thanks to the cell queue
 feature, OR conns don&#39;t get full any more.
 - Remove the old &quot;dns worker&quot; server DNS code: it hasn&#39;t been default
 since 0.1.2.2-alpha, and all the servers are using the new
 eventdns code.
 - Remove the code to generate the oldest (v1) directory format.
 - Remove support for the old bw_accounting file: we&#39;ve been storing
 bandwidth accounting information in the state file since
 0.1.2.5-alpha. This may result in bandwidth accounting errors
 if you try to upgrade from 0.1.1.x or earlier, or if you try to
 downgrade to 0.1.1.x or earlier.
 - Drop support for OpenSSL version 0.9.6. Just about nobody was using
 it, it had no AES, and it hasn&#39;t seen any security patches since
 2004.
 - Stop overloading the circuit_t.onionskin field for both &quot;onionskin
 from a CREATE cell that we are waiting for a cpuworker to be
 assigned&quot; and &quot;onionskin from an EXTEND cell that we are going to
 send to an OR as soon as we are connected&quot;. Might help with bug 600.
 - Remove the tor_strpartition() function: its logic was confused,
 and it was only used for one thing that could be implemented far
 more easily.
 - Remove the contrib scripts ExerciseServer.py, PathDemo.py,
 and TorControl.py, as they use the old v0 controller protocol,
 and are obsoleted by TorFlow anyway.
 - Drop support for v1 rendezvous descriptors, since we never used
 them anyway, and the code has probably rotted by now. Based on
 patch from Karsten Loesing.
 - Stop allowing address masks that do not correspond to bit prefixes.
 We have warned about these for a really long time; now it&#39;s time
 to reject them. (Patch from croup.)
 - Remove an optimization in the AES counter-mode code that assumed
 that the counter never exceeded 2^68. When the counter can be set
 arbitrarily as an IV (as it is by Karsten&#39;s new hidden services
 code), this assumption no longer holds.
 - Disable the SETROUTERPURPOSE controller command: it is now
 obsolete.</p>

	      <p>A quick trip report from the <a href="http://www.nnedv.org">National Network to End Domestic Violence</a> training conference. I gave a series of presentations to the people who help victims of abuse. The day started off with an introduction to the technology issues surrounding victims of abuse and stalking. An overview of the challenges they face, the methods that are used against them, and the &quot;dark side&quot; of technologies such as RFID, Bluetooth, and GPS.</p>

<p>My presentation was an overview of Tor, online anonymity, and places to find more information. The afternoon sessions covered the legal environment and risks for victims. The speakers covered online harassment, the plights of women on welfare and their oppression via technology (&quot;the new punitiveness&quot; as it was termed), and a quick hypothetical situation about jilted lovers and their legal recourse; from both sides.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great set of new organizations and people to meet for the Tor Project.</p>

<p>Update: NNEDV has posted some of their extensive <a href="http://nnedv.org/resources/safetynetdocs.html">documents online</a> for review.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.29-rc (released July 8) fixes two big bugs with using bridges, fixes more hidden-service performance bugs, and fixes a bunch of smaller bugs.

<p>Torbutton 1.2.0rc6 (released July 12) features fixes for a nasty history loss bug, an exception during Tor toggle, javascript being disabled in some tabs, better pref handling, and more.

<p>Tor 0.2.0.30 (released July 15) is the first stable release of the 0.2.0.x branch. The previous stable branch (0.1.2.x) went stable in April of 2007. We are still waiting for Torbutton and Vidalia to stabilize before announcing the Windows and OS X packages on the or-announce announcements
list. We expect to do that in August.</p>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.1 (released July 20) updates Vidalia to release 0.1.6, updates Pidgin Portable to 2.4.3, updates Pidgin OTR plugin to 3.2, updates Tor to 0.2.1.2-alpha, updates Torbutton to 1.2.0rc6, and sets TZ=UTC environment variable in RelativeLink (needed by Torbutton).

<p>Torbutton 1.2.0 (released July 30) is finally a stable release for the new Torbutton tree that includes application-level privacy protections.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/CHANGELOG" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/CHANGELOG">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbutton/trunk/src/CHANGELOG</a></p>

<p>From the Tor 0.2.0.29-rc ChangeLog:
&quot;When a hidden service was trying to establish an introduction point, and Tor had built circuits preemptively for such purposes, we were ignoring all the preemptive circuits and launching a new one instead. Bugfix on 0.2.0.14-alpha.&quot;
&quot;When a hidden service was trying to establish an introduction point, and Tor *did* manage to reuse one of the preemptively built circuits, it didn&#39;t correctly remember which one it used, so it asked for another one soon after, until there were no more preemptive circuits, at which point it launched one from scratch. Bugfix on 0.0.9.x.&quot;</p>

<p>The upcoming Tor 0.2.1.3-alpha and 0.2.1.4-alpha releases include more fixes for hidden service performance and robustness, have slightly improved bootstrap status event behavior, and start hunting down a horrible bug that looks like it could leak private information:

<p><strong>Proposals:</strong></p>

<p>Proposal 145 (Separate &quot;suitable as a guard&quot; from &quot;suitable as a new guard&quot;) suggests one approach for separating the role of &quot;is still useful as an entry guard&quot; from &quot;should be an option when choosing a new entry guard&quot;. This step will help us load balance over the network better.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/145-newguard-flag.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/145-newguard-flag.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/145-newguard...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 146 (Add new flag to reflect long-term stability) discusses how to ship the Tor client with a set of alternate sources for initial bootstrap directory information. We already have this feature in Tor 0.2.0.x, called the &quot;fallback consensus&quot;, but we never enabled it because the Tor client would spend too long trying directory mirrors that were long since gone from the network. This proposal moves us closer to being able to distinguish the more long-term reliable mirrors.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/146-long-term-stability.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/146-long-term-stability.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/146-long-ter...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 147 (Eliminate the need for v2 directories in generating v3 directories) helps wean us off of needing the old deprecated v2 directory design. Currently we only use it to give advance warning to the v3 authorities about relays that haven&#39;t heard about yet, so they can fetch information about those relays before the time arrives to make an official vote about their state.

<p>Proposal 148 (Stream end reasons from the client side should be uniform) describes a simple fix for a potential anonymity flaw in Tor&#39;s core protocol for passing explanations from one end of a Tor circuit to the other when an application stream ends.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/148-uniform-client-end-reason.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/148-uniform-client-end-reason.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/148-uniform-...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 149 (Using data from NETINFO cells) starts talking about how to make use of the timestamp and IP address listed in Tor&#39;s new NETINFO cells. In theory we can use them to decide if our clock is skewed, and to decide if a traffic analysis man-in-the-middle attack is happening against us. In practice it appears more complex than we expected.

<p>Proposal 150 (Exclude Exit Nodes from a circuit) allows users to specify which relays should never be used as the last (exit) hop in a circuit. We took the proposal one step further and allowed users to also specify IP addresses and netmasks for which relays to avoid in the exit position.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/150-exclude-exit-nodes.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/150-exclude-exit-nodes.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/150-exclude-...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 151 (Improving Tor Path Selection) is a draft proposal to implement the results of Fallon Chen&#39;s Google Summer of Code project. Her plan is to measure the expected time it takes to establish a circuit, and then abandon circuits that take significantly longer than that to form. The assumption is that circuits that take a long time to set up will generally have unacceptably high latency as well.
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/151-path-selection-improvements.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/151-path-selection-improvements.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/151-path-sel...</a></p>

<p>Proposal 154 (Automatic Software Update Protocol) starts the discussion of how to let Vidalia automatically manage updates for Tor, Polipo, Vidalia, etc. This is very important for keeping users up to date with respect to security and stability fixes. We will especially aim to do the updates over Tor, a) for privacy, and b) so users who are blocked from the Tor website will still be able to upgrade seamlessly.

<p><strong>Research:</strong></p>

<p>Karsten Loesing&#39;s report on 7 ways to improve the performance and robustness of Tor hidden services:
 <a href="http://freehaven.net/%7Ekarsten/hidserv/discussion-2008-07-15.pdf" title="http://freehaven.net/~karsten/hidserv/discussion-2008-07-15.pdf">http://freehaven.net/~karsten/hidserv/discussion-2008-07-15.pdf</a></p>

<p>Four new research papers on Tor came out in July:
 <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#loesing2008performance" title="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#loesing2008performance">http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#loesing2008performance</a>

<p>We continued evaluating the TBB footprints here:
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt</a></p>

<p>In particular, we added a new &quot;Registry modifications&quot; section to that file, describing some new traces that appear to be left behind after operating Tor Browser Bundle, even from the USB key. One of the most worrying is the &quot;user assist&quot; registry key that gets set, and (incredible as it sounds) is obfuscated by rot-13 before being set.</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use:</strong></p>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.1 (released July 20) updates Vidalia to release 0.1.6, updates Pidgin Portable to 2.4.3, updates Pidgin OTR plugin to 3.2, updates Tor to 0.2.1.2-alpha, updates Torbutton to 1.2.0rc6, and sets TZ=UTC environment variable in RelativeLink (needed by Torbutton).</p>

<p>The first Incognito (Gentoo-based Tor LiveCD) release of 2008 is also nearing completion, and we expect to see it released in August.</p>

<p>Finally, we contracted to start work on the Tor VM project. The idea is to run a Linux kernel and a Tor client inside a thin VM (like QEMU) on Windows, and then transparently intercept outgoing connections and redirect them into Tor. This approach will a) make proxy-avoiding side-channel and sidejacking attacks less devastating, and b) isolate the Tor client from the rest of the OS to provide a more robust security approach. Current design document is under development at

<p><strong>Getting Tor:</strong></p>

<p>We have established our &quot;gettor&quot; email auto-responder script that lets people mail <a href="mailto:gettor@torproject.org">gettor@torproject.org</a> and retrieve a copy of Tor from their mailbox. We still need to ponder more usability issues, such as translation.
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/finding-tor" title="https://www.torproject.org/finding-tor">https://www.torproject.org/finding-tor</a></p>

<p>We have also automated the process of checking Tor website mirrors: there&#39;s a new update-mirrors.pl script in the website directory that generates a list of mirrors ordered by when they last synced with the main website.
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/mirrors" title="https://www.torproject.org/mirrors">https://www.torproject.org/mirrors</a></p>

<p><strong>Translations:</strong></p>

<p>We have our translation server up and online:
 <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/" title="https://translation.torproject.org/">https://translation.torproject.org/</a></p>

<p>We revised our translation tutorial here:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal" title="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal">https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal</a></p>

<p>Users continued to submit updated translations for many different languages.</p>

<p>We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website
translations. We added Vidalia, Torbutton, and website translations
into Farsi.</p>

<p>We also added the strings for Vidalia&#39;s installer; this required writing several scripts to convert from the &quot;nsh&quot; (nullscript installer language) format to the &quot;po&quot; (preferred by Pootle) format and back.</p>
