          </p>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>There have been a lot of questions today about just what <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">the
recent Debian OpenSSL</a> flaw means for Tor clients. Here&#39;s an attempt to
explain it in a bit more detail. (Go read <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html">the Tor security advisory</a> before
reading this post.)</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s look at the security/anonymity implications for users who
aren&#39;t running on Debian, Ubuntu, or similar. These implications all
stem from the fact that some of the Tor relays and v3 directory authorities
have weak keys, so the Tor network isn&#39;t able to provide as much anonymity
as we would like.</p>

<p>The biggest issue is that perhaps 300 Tor relays were running with
weak keys and weak crypto, out of the roughly 1500-2000 total running
relays. What can an attacker do from this? If you happen to pick three
weak relays in a row for your circuit, then somebody watching your local
network connection (or watching the first relay you pick) could break all
the layers of Tor encryption and read the traffic as if they were watching
it at the exit relay. (I don&#39;t want to say they could read the plaintext,
because if you used end-to-end encryption like SSL they wouldn&#39;t be able
to see inside of that -- unless of course the webserver you contact is
running Debian and affected by this bug!) Because this attacker can read
the traffic inside Tor, they would also break your anonymity: they know
both you and the destination(s) you asked for.</p>

<p>Worse, this attack works against past traffic too: what if an attacker
logged traffic over the past two years? As long as there&#39;s a single
non-weak non-colluding Tor relay in your circuit, you&#39;re fine -- that
relay will provide encryption that the attacker can&#39;t break, then or
now. But if you ever picked a path that consisted entirely of relays
with broken RNGs, and an attacker logged this traffic, then he can unwrap
the traffic from his logs using the same approach as above.</p>

<p>(Somebody who knows a Tor relay&#39;s private key could also impersonate that
relay. So he can do a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting your traffic
to the &quot;real&quot; Tor relay and handling it himself. But this wouldn&#39;t give
him anything that he can&#39;t already do just by watching. Another attack would
be to create a fake descriptor and upload that. But this wouldn&#39;t give him
anything he can&#39;t do by starting his own relay and uploading a descriptor for it.)</p>

<p>This evening we&#39;ve begun the process of making the directory authorities
reject all uploaded descriptors that are signed using these keys, so
we will effectively cut them out of the network. Peter Palfrader, our
Tor debian package maintainer, has also put out a new deb package that
will automatically discard the old relay keys when the relays upgrade,
so they&#39;ll automatically generate new safe keys.</p>

<p>The next big issue is that three of the six v3 directory authorities
were using weak keys for their directory votes and signatures. This
issue doesn&#39;t affect Tor clients running the 0.1.2.x (stable) series,
since those clients use the v2 directory system, none of whose keys
(I think) are weak.</p>

<p>What can three v3 authorities do? If they could forge a new v3
networkstatus consensus, they could trick users into using their own
fabricated Tor network, which would totally ruin their anonymity. Worse,
they could do this in a way that would be very hard to detect, by just
giving out their forged consensus to a few target users and giving out
the &quot;real&quot; consensus the rest of the time. But fortunately, Tor clients
require a majority of signatures before they&#39;ll believe the consensus --
and that&#39;s four of six. (Whew, that was close!)</p>

<p>Now, three v3 authorities can still influence the consensus a lot. As
one example, they could pick their favorite relays (say, because they
operate those relays, or because those are the ones that are easiest to
monitor), and put in three votes claiming that all the other relays are
unusable. The resulting consensus will then list only those relays as
&quot;Running&quot;, since no other relays got enough votes. Then we&#39;re back to
the above scenario. But in this case at least one other v3 authority
would need to participate in building the consensus, so this couldn&#39;t be
a selective one-off attack. The whole consensus would appear different
to everybody, and hopefully somebody would notice.</p>

<p>The 0.2.0.26-rc release resolves these concerns by replacing those
three weak identity keys with new strong ones. Once you upgrade, your
new Tor won&#39;t trust any of those old keys -- so if anybody tries the
above attacks on you, your Tor won&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>And the last issue that affects non-Debian users? If you use a hidden
service that generated its &quot;.onion&quot; key on a weak system, then you can
no longer be sure that you&#39;re actually talking to the original person
who generated the key. That&#39;s because somebody else might have figured
out the private key for that service, and started advertising it himself.
(Ordinarily, hidden services guarantee that nobody can intercept and read
or modify your communications with the service, because only the person
on the other end knows the private key that generated the &quot;.onion&quot; name.)</p>

<p>Now, what about the effects on Tor clients that run Debian, Ubuntu,
or the like? Well, first they&#39;re affected by all the above attacks. And
on top of that, any encryption they do can be considered to have no real
effect. So for example if an attacker can observe your traffic either
locally or at the first relay, he can see right through it all.</p>

<p>Similarly, if anybody has logs of traffic coming out of a Debian or Ubuntu
Tor client, they can strip it of its encryption, and thus retroactively
break the anonymity.</p>

<p>And lastly, don&#39;t forget there are plenty of other issues that this
OpenSSL bug causes that are unrelated to Tor. As a simple example, if your
bank generated its SSL cert on Debian or Ubuntu, then your SSL connection
to your bank (likely including your password) is readable. Or if you ever
tried to ssh into (or out of) an affected system, you have a problem. I
imagine some broader lists of examples will start appearing soon.</p>

          <p>Tor 0.2.0.24-rc (released Apr 22) adds dizum (run by Alex de Joode)
as the new sixth v3 directory authority, makes relays with dynamic IP
addresses and no DirPort notice more quickly when their IP address
changes, fixes a few rare crashes and memory leaks, and fixes a few
other miscellaneous bugs. Tor 0.2.0.25-rc (released Apr 23) makes Tor
work again on OS X and certain BSDs.
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00014.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00014.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/May-2008/msg00014.html</a></p>

<p>Torbutton 1.1.18 (released Apr 17) fixes many usability and interoperability
items, in an attempt to make the new Torbutton not so obnoxious in its
zeal to protect the user. It also includes new translations for French,
Russian, Farsi, Italian, and Spanish.</p>

<p>We did a complete overhaul of the <a href="https://check.torproject.org/" title="https://check.torproject.org/">https://check.torproject.org/</a>
page. Now it accepts a language choice,
e.g. <a href="https://check.torproject.org/?lang=fa-IR" title="https://check.torproject.org/?lang=fa-IR">https://check.torproject.org/?lang=fa-IR</a>
Available languages are German, English, Spanish, Italian, Farsi,
Japanese, Polish, Portugese, Russian, and Chinese. The Tor Browser
Bundle automatically uses the appropriate language as its home page,
based on which language of the Browser Bundle was downloaded.</p>

<p>Started on a documentation page to explain to users what bridges are,
how they can decide whether they need one, and how to configure their
Tor client to use them:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges.html" title="https://www.torproject.org/bridges.html">https://www.torproject.org/bridges.html</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve also started working on a design proposal for making it easier
to set up a private or testing Tor network. With the advent of the v3
directory protocol, it currently takes up to 30 minutes before a test
network will produce a useful networkstatus consensus. Also, there are
a dozen different config options that need to be set correctly for
a Tor network running on a single IP address to not trigger various
security defenses. This approach should let more people set up their
own Tor networks, either for testing or because they can&#39;t reach the
main Tor network.
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/135-private-tor-networks.txt" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/135-private-tor-networks.txt">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/135-private-tor-...</a></p>

<p>We have the beginnings of a grand plan for how to successfully scale
the Tor network to orders of magnitude more relays than we have
currently. Much more work and thinking remain.
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-grand-scaling-plan.txt" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-grand-scaling-plan.txt">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-grand-...</a></p>

<p>We also did a retrospective on currently open but not finished design
proposals, so we don&#39;t have as many &quot;open&quot; proposals in the pipeline
but not getting attention:
 <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Apr-2008/msg00009.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Apr-2008/msg00009.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Apr-2008/msg00009.html</a></p>

<p>We added several more research papers that we&#39;d like to see written to
the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/volunteer#Research" title="https://www.torproject.org/volunteer#Research">https://www.torproject.org/volunteer#Research</a> page. In May we&#39;ll add
a few more and then start pointing academic professors at the new list.</p>

<p>The development version of Vidalia now has GUI boxes to configure an http
proxy that Vidalia should launch when it starts. (The Tor Browser Bundle
already uses these config options internally to launch Polipo when it
starts.) The next steps are to make sure that Polipo (our preferred new
http proxy) is stable enough on Windows, and then start shipping some
new standard bundles with Polipo rather than Privoxy.</p>

<p>We cleaned up the Torbutton install in the OS X bundles so it installs
Torbutton for the local user, rather than global. Hopefully this will
make OS X users happier.</p>

<p>We&#39;re making progress on integrating a UPnP library into Vidalia. This
feature will allow users who want to set up a Tor relay but don&#39;t want
to muck with manual port forwarding on their router/firewall to just
click a button and have Vidalia interact with their router/firewall
automatically. This approach won&#39;t work in all cases, but it should work
in at least some. We hope to land the first version of this in May.</p>

<p>Steven Murdoch and Robert Watson worked towards a final version of
their PETS 2008 paper called &quot;Metrics for Security and Performance in
Low-Latency Anonymity Systems.&quot; The final version will be available in
May at:
 <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Esjm217/papers/pets08metrics.pdf" title="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/pets08metrics.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/pets08metrics.pdf</a></p>

<p>So far there appear to be no free-software zip splitters that work
on Windows and produce self-contained exe files for automatically
reconstructing the file. Rather than using a closed-source shareware
application (as it seems a shame to put a trust gap in our build process
when we don&#39;t need to), the current plan is to write some instructions
for users to fetch the 7zip program, and then fetch a set of blocks,
and run a batch file to reconstruct them. We&#39;re in the process of trying
to learn how large the blocks can be -- preliminary guess is 2MB.</p>

<p>We have a first draft of a translation portal up here:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal" title="https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal">https://www.torproject.org/translation-portal</a></p>

<p>The Vidalia GUI now has (manual) translation instructions:
 <a href="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations" title="http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/wiki/Translations</a></p>

<p>We&#39;ve registered the Vidalia project on &quot;LaunchPad&quot;, which is a
web-based translation site that is compatible with Vidalia&#39;s string
format:
 <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/vidalia/trunk/+pots/vidalia" title="https://translations.launchpad.net/vidalia/trunk/+pots/vidalia">https://translations.launchpad.net/vidalia/trunk/+pots/vidalia</a>
We&#39;re currently working to try to upload our current translations into
the LaunchPad interface.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve registered the Torbutton project on &quot;BabelZilla&quot;, which is a
web-based translation site designed specifically for Firefox extensions.
We&#39;ve uploaded the current translation strings:
 <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&amp;Itemid=88&amp;extension=3510&amp;type=lang" title="http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com\_wts&amp;Itemid=88&amp;extension=3510&amp;type=lang">http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&amp;Itemid=88&amp;extension=3...</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we&#39;ve begun developer-oriented documentation for how to manage
and maintain these various translation web-interfaces:
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/translations.txt" title="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/translations.txt">https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/translations.txt</a></p>

          <p>Tor-0.2.0.26-rc replaces several V3 directory authority keys affected by a recent <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">Debian OpenSSL bug</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This is a security-critical release.</strong></p>

<p>Everybody running any version in the 0.2.0.x series should upgrade, whether
they are running Debian or not. Also, all servers running any version of Tor
whose keys were generated by Debian, Ubuntu, or any derived distribution may
have to replace their identity keys. See our <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html">security advisory</a> for full details. As always, you can find Tor 0.2.0.26-rc on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download">downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.26-rc - 2008-05-13
Major security fixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use new V3 directory authority keys on the tor26, gabelmoo, and moria1 V3 directory authorities. The old keys were generated with a vulnerable version of Debian&#39;s OpenSSL package, and must be considered compromised. Other authorities&#39; keys were not generatedwith an affected version of OpenSSL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>List authority signatures as &quot;unrecognized&quot; based on DirServer lines, not on cert cache. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a new V3AuthUseLegacyKey option to make it easier for authorities to change their identity keys if they have to.</li>
