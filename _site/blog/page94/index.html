        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Last week, <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/peter-eckersley">Peter Eckersley</a> and I met with the Mozilla team in Mountain view to discuss web fingerprinting, privacy and Torbutton. I gave <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/MozillaBrownBag.pdf">an updated version of my Torbutton Design talk</a>, and Peter discussed <a href="http://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</a>. Mozilla was primarily interested in hearing about these projects in the context of their <a href="https://support.mozilla.com/en-us/kb/private+browsing">Private Browsing Mode</a>, which they unveiled in Firefox 3.5.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/PrivateBrowsing">primary goal</a> of their Private Browsing Mode is to protect against a local after-the-fact attacker - an attacker that has local access to a user&#39;s filesystem after browsing has taken place. They offer some limited protections against a network adversary, but this was not their initial goal, and is primarily a side effect of trying to protect against &quot;helpful&quot; web services, such as Google Search History, which record your activity somewhere other than your PC.</p>

<p>This is a significantly weaker adversary model than <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#adversary">the one used in the Torbutton design.</a> As a result, from the point of view of Tor usage, Firefox Private Browsing mode suffers from a number of weaknesses that Torbutton does not.</p>

<p>In particular, Firefox does not presently concern itself with plugins, form and password autocompletion, SSL state, Live Bookmarks, external protocols and applications, or browser fingerprinting. The Applied Crypto research group at Stanford recently published a <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/%7Edabo/pubs/abstracts/privatebrowsing.html">comparison of the four major browser&#39;s private browsing modes</a> against a dedicated local and remote adversary which details some of these issues.</p>

<p>It turns out there is some developer interest inside Mozilla in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting">improving resistance to fingerprinting</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thirdparty">improving privacy against third party content</a>, and hardening their Private Browsing Mode in general, despite most of these issues being outside of their original model. The current plan is to investigate what would be necessary to develop an <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing">Anonymous Browsing Mode</a> that would either take the form of a privacy setting, an enhancement to Private Browsing Mode, or an entirely independent browsing mode. The trick now is to transform this developer interest into something that motivates the Firefox Product Management team to get fully behind the proposed improvements.</p>

<p>As such, Peter and I have been spending some time updating the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing">Anonymous Browsing</a> wiki pages to describe <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing#Use_Cases">who would want such privacy features</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing#Behavior">how they would behave</a>, as well as updating and adding relevant Mozilla Bugzilla entries. I&#39;ve also updated the list of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/design/#FirefoxBugs">Torbutton Firefox Bugs</a> to reflect some of the more sophisticated unsolved fingerprinting issues that were brought up during our meeting.</p>

<p>This July, the two of us will be doing the same thing with the Google Chrome Privacy Team in Berlin while at the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/events/tor-privacy-enhancing-technologies-symposium-berlin-germany">Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium</a>. This is primarily to follow up on a meeting we had with Google in December, where we discussed <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions/browse_thread/thread/ceba26ca9e2f6a78?hl=en">the barriers to the development of a Torbutton for Google Chrome</a>, and to discuss relevant fingerprinting issues and similar shortcomings of the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464">Google Chrome Incognito Mode</a>.</p>

<p>Look for a future blog post in August detailing the results of that discussion.</p>

          <p>You&#39;ve flooded the blog and tor-assistants with lots of cries for help about Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, and a slew of VPNs all being blocked. Sometimes this is through MTN Nigera, sometimes not.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG" title="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG">http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG</a> suggests access is a 50/50 chance for some sites.</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Iins...</a>. That FAQ entry is a fine place to start. Telling us Tor doesn&#39;t work lets us know there is a problem. Sending in logs from Message Log would be a great start. We need to know what Tor records while trying to connect to the Tor Network.</p>

<p>Someone could further startup Wireshark and record the entire session of Tor starting up and ultimately failing to connect to the Tor Network.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways ISPs in Nigeria can block Tor and your favorite websites. DNS filtering, IP blacklisting, proxy server keyword filtering, govt mandated blackbox firewalls/proxy servers, or just simply blocking the published tor relays list. The worst case is Nigeria white lists the Internet, allowing you to only visit approved sites (and probably man-in-the-middled as well).</p>

<p>All we know right now is that some ISPs in Nigeria seem to be blocking many websites, tools, and Tor. More data is needed to figure out some solutions.</p>

<p>Updates 2010-07-01: Two people have given us some data from <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1645">MTN</a> and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1625">Etisalat</a> ISPs. It seems these two ISPs have implemented some general &quot;circumvention tool&quot; blocking.</p>

          <p>Today the EFF and the Tor Project are launching a public beta of a new Firefox extension called <a href="https://eff.org/https-everywhere/">HTTPS Everywhere</a>.</p>

<p>This Firefox extension was inspired by the launch of Google&#39;s encrypted search option. We wanted a way to ensure that every search our browsers sent was encrypted, including the search box and URL bar features. At the same time, we were also able to encrypt most or all of the browser&#39;s communications with other popular sites that support SSL, but don&#39;t provide it by default.</p>

<p>Our approach is based on the <a href="http://hackademix.net/2009/09/23/strict-transport-security-in-noscript/">NoScript STS</a> implementation, but is more expressive in the manner in which <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets">HTTPS-enforcing rules are written</a>.</p>

<p>This tends to work more effectively than NoScript because many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may not offer all pages and applications via HTTPS, or may only allow HTTPS activity via alternate subdomains that require URL rewriting and redirection. In particular, Google&#39;s SSL search and Wikipedia both require rather complex URL rewriting and exception filters to work properly.</p>

<p>HTTPS Everywhere should also perform more securely than DOM-based mechanisms such as the GreaseMoney-based <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/72944">SSL Certificates Pro</a> and the Google Chrome-based <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/flcpelgcagfhfoegekianiofphddckof?hl=en">KB Enforcer</a>. These addons perform redirection at the DOM level, which causes many HTTP fetches to leak prior to the redirect to HTTPS.</p>

<p>We currently provide rule sets for Google Search, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, The New York Times, The Washington Post, IxQuick, and many more popular sites. It is also possible to <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets">add user-defined rule files</a>, and/or to submit rules to us for inclusion in future versions.</p>

<p>Note that some of these sites still include a lot of content from third party domains that are not available over HTTPS. As always, if the browser&#39;s lock icon is broken or carries an exclamation mark, you may remain vulnerable to adversaries that use active attacks or traffic analysis to compromise your privacy and security.</p>

          <p><strong>New releases</strong></p>

<p>On May 26, Tor Browser Bundle for Microsoft Windows is updated to include the newer Vidalia 0.2.9. This ﬁxes some issues with character set handling, and adds Vietnamese as a new language.</p>

<p>On May 31, we released Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 1.0.6. It contains the following updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add arch to tarball name so there&#39;s no collision</li>
<li>Add libpng for Arch Linux</li>
<li>Add HTTPS Everywhere extension</li>
<li>Update Qt to 4.6.2</li>
<li>Update Vidalia to 0.2.9</li>
<li>Update NoScript to 1.9.9.80</li>
</ul>

<p>On June 1st, we released Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 1.0.7. It uses an older glibc for better compatibility with older linux distributions.</p>

<p>On May 20, we released Vidalia 0.2.9. Fixes include Qt 4.6.2 compatibility, new cert, and some new translations. You can download it at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/" title="https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/">https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/</a>. Packages are slowly being updated to include this version of Vidalia.
The full changelog is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the GoDaddy CA certificate bundle since we changed the certificate used to authenticate connections to geoips.vidalia-project.net for downloading GeoIP information from a commercial GoDaddy certificate to a free CACert certificate.</li>
<li>Define -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501 on Windows builds so that MiniUPnPc will build with the latest versions of MinGW.</li>
<li>Modify miniupnpc.c from MiniUPnPc&#39;s source so that it will build on Mac OS X 10.4.</li>
<li>Work around Qt&#39;s new behavior for the QT_WA macro so that Vidalia will work correctly again on Windows with Qt &gt;= 4.6.</li>
</ul>

<p>On May 2nd, we released an updated stable version of Tor, 0.2.1.26.
The detailed list of changes is:</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes:
 - Teach relays to defend themselves from connection overload. Relays
 now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were intended
 for directory fetches. Relays are also more aggressive about closing
 TLS connections that have no circuits on them. Such circuits are
 unlikely to be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling
 up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets
 and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling
 their directory fetches over TLS).
 - Fix SSL renegotiation behavior on OpenSSL versions like on Centos
 that claim to be earlier than 0.9.8m, but which have in reality
 backported huge swaths of 0.9.8m or 0.9.8n renegotiation
 behavior. Possible fix for some cases of bug 1346.
 - Directory mirrors were fetching relay descriptors only from v2
 directory authorities, rather than v3 authorities like they should.
 Only 2 v2 authorities remain (compared to 7 v3 authorities), leading
 to a serious bottleneck. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha. Fixes bug 1324.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:
 - Finally get rid of the deprecated and now harmful notion of &quot;clique
 mode&quot;, where directory authorities maintain TLS connections to
 every other relay.</p>

<p>o Testsuite fixes:
 - In the util/threads test, no longer free the test_mutex before all
 worker threads have finished. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.
 - The master thread could starve the worker threads quite badly on
 certain systems, causing them to run only partially in the allowed
 window. This resulted in test failures. Now the master thread sleeps
 occasionally for a few microseconds while the two worker-threads
 compete for the mutex. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</p>

<p>On May 19, we released an updated OrBot (Tor for Android), version 0.0.6, which contains Tor 0.2.2.13-alpha.</p>

<p>On May 26, we released an updated Orbot (Tor for Android), version 0.0.7, which contains a number of usability fixes reported by users. See the bugfixes <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=closed&amp;component=Android+(Orbot)-Backend+/+Core&amp;order=priority&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;owner=">in trac</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Design, develop, and implement enhancements that make Tor a better tool for users in censored countries.</strong></p>

<p>On May 4, China&#39;s Great Firewall began blocking connections to the public Tor relays. They also updated their blocking to include bridge relays published via email and https websites. Further research into the blocking mechanisms from inside China show they are simply blocking IP Address and TCP port combinations. Bridge relays that have been seeded into various social networks in China continue to work well.</p>

<p>Tor on the Android OS, called Orbot, continues progress. Work continues on a privacy-preserving web browser, Orweb, and other supporting applications to make Tor on Android more useful for daily users. Nathan got a Tor relay running on a Moons e-7001 “iRobot” tablet, <a href="http://guardianproject.info/2010/05/25/tor-on-a-tablet">tor on a tablet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jacob, Roger, Runa, and Linus talked to various NorduNet and SUNET people in Sweden. As a result, we have a new directory authority and bandwidth authority located within NorduNET.</li>
<li>Erinn and Karen attended the Global Voices Summit 2010 in Santiago, Chile. There were a number of discussions about how to use Tor safely and its usage in activism. Erinn held a detailed Tor training for 5-10 activists in Spanish. <a href="http://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org" title="http://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org">http://summit2010.globalvoicesonline.org</a></li>
<li>Roger gave a few talks as AUSCERT, <a href="http://www.auscert.org.au/" title="http://www.auscert.org.au/">http://www.auscert.org.au/</a></li>
<li>Roger was interviewed by The Australian about Internet censorship and privacy. <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/call-to-join-tor-network-to-fight-censorship/story-e6frgakx-1225870756466" title="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/call-to-join-tor-network-to-fight-censorship/story-e6frgakx-1225870756466">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/call-to-join-tor-network-t...</a></li>
<li>Roger was interviewed by ComputerWorld Australia about the relationship between China and Tor. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/347273/auscert_2010_china_set_net_blackout_tiananmen_square_anniversary/" title="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/347273/auscert\_2010\_china\_set\_net\_blackout\_tiananmen\_square\_anniversary/">http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/347273/auscert_2010_china_set_ne...</a></li>
<li>Jacob gave the keynote speech at CONFidence in Krakow, Poland, <a href="http://2010.confidence.org.pl/" title="http://2010.confidence.org.pl/">http://2010.confidence.org.pl/</a>.</li>
<li>Jacob, Christian, and others attended pH neutral in Berlin, Germany. <a href="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/" title="http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/">http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/</a></li>
<li>Karen met with a sub-committee of the US Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss the fallacy of cyberwar.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.</strong>
Continued to work on Linux and Mac OS X tor browser bundles. The Mac version of TBB is going to use a sandboxing technology borrowed from IronFox. This should help minimize the footprint and security concerns about running TBB on OS X computers.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong>
From the 0.2.1.26 release notes, teach relays to defend themselves from connection overload. Relays now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were intended for directory fetches. Relays are also more aggressive about closing TLS connections that have no circuits on them. Such circuits are unlikely to be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling their directory fetches over TLS).</p>

<p><strong>Translation work, ultimately a browser-based approach.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added the Android orbot application to the translation portal.</li>
<li>By user request, add Serbian to the available languages.</li>
<li>Translation updates for the following languages: Polish, Arabic, Greek, Serbian, Russian, Swedish, Chinese, Norwegian, Japanese, German, Spanish, Portugese, French, Dutch, Romanian, and Farsi.</li>
</ul>

          <p>Tor 0.2.1.26 addresses the recent connection and memory overload problems we&#39;ve been seeing on relays, especially relays with their DirPort open. If your relay has been crashing, or you turned it off because it used too many resources, give this release a try.</p>

<p>This release also fixes yet another instance of broken OpenSSL libraries that was causing some relays to drop out of the consensus.</p>

<p>Available for download at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.26
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Teach relays to defend themselves from connection overload. Relays
now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were intended
for directory fetches. Relays are also more aggressive about closing
TLS connections that have no circuits on them. Such circuits are
unlikely to be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling
up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets
and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling
their directory fetches over TLS).</li>
<li>Fix SSL renegotiation behavior on OpenSSL versions like on Centos
that claim to be earlier than 0.9.8m, but which have in reality
backported huge swaths of 0.9.8m or 0.9.8n renegotiation
behavior. Possible fix for some cases of bug 1346.</li>
<li>Directory mirrors were fetching relay descriptors only from v2
directory authorities, rather than v3 authorities like they should.
Only 2 v2 authorities remain (compared to 7 v3 authorities), leading
to a serious bottleneck. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha. Fixes bug 1324.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally get rid of the deprecated and now harmful notion of &quot;clique
mode&quot;, where directory authorities maintain TLS connections to
every other relay.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testsuite fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In the util/threads test, no longer free the test_mutex before all
worker threads have finished. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>The master thread could starve the worker threads quite badly on
certain systems, causing them to run only partially in the allowed
window. This resulted in test failures. Now the master thread sleeps
occasionally for a few microseconds while the two worker-threads
compete for the mutex. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>
