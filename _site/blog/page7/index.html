	      <p>The first alpha release of the 4.5 series is available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha">extended downloads page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/4.5-alpha-1/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<p>This release features a circuit status reporting UI (visible on the green Tor onion button menu), as well as isolation for circuit use. All content elements for a website will use a single circuit, and different websites should use different circuits, even when viewed at the same time. The Security Slider is also present in this release, and can be configured from the green Tor onion&#39;s Preferences menu, under the Privacy and Security settings tab. It also features HTTPS certificate pinning for selected sites (including our updater), which was backported from Firefox 32.</p>

<p>This release also features a rewrite of the obfs3 pluggable transport, and the introduction of the new obfs4 transport. Please test these transports and report any issues!</p>

<p><strong>Note to Mac users</strong>: As part of <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/end-life-plan-tor-browser-32-bit-macs">our planned end-of-life for supporting 32 bit Macs</a>, the Mac edition of this release is 64 bit only, which also means that the updater will not work for Mac users on the alpha series release channel for this release. Once you transition to this 64 bit release, the updater should function correctly after that.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>We are planning to discontinue support for 32 bit Macs for Tor Browser.</p>

<p>We&#39;re doing this for two main reasons. First, Apple itself no longer supports 32 bit Macs. The only remaining 32 bit Mac users are on OSX 10.6, which Apple ended support for in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/03/snow-leopard-updates-are-probably-done-here-are-your-os-x-upgrade-options/">February of this year</a>. Second, 64 bit software has improved security properties by way of improved address space layout randomization (ASLR), which makes exploitation more difficult.</p>

<p>This transition will happen in phases: First, the upcoming 4.5-alpha series will only be available as 64 bit builds. We will continue releasing 32 bit versions of the 4.0 series until the 4.5 series is declared stable. When the 4.5 release stabilizes, all support for 32 bit Macs will end. The 4.5 release series will be stable &quot;when it&#39;s ready&quot;, but we know we need to perform at least two more releases in this series to properly exercise the new security features in the updater. This means that 32 bit Mac users likely have a month or two to decide what to do.</p>

<p>Current 32 bit Mac users have a few options. If your actual Mac hardware is 64 bit capable, you can upgrade to either the 64 bit edition of OSX 10.6 (which we will continue to support for a bit longer), or use the app store to upgrade to 10.9 or 10.10.</p>

<p>If your hardware is not 64 bit capable and won&#39;t run these newer Mac operating systems, you should still be able to use <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html">Tails</a>, which contains the Tor Browser. You can run Tails in a virtual machine such as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, or you can <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac/index.en.html">manually install it to a USB disk from the Mac OS Terminal</a>. If you install Tails to a USB stick, you will need to <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/start_tails/index.en.html#index2h2">reboot your Mac</a> in order to use it.</p>

<h1>All Mac Users: Manual Update Required</h1>

<p>The transition from 32 bit Mac bundles to 64 bit Mac bundles means that our (currently experimental) in-browser updater will not transition any Mac users to the 64bit version automatically, even if your Mac is already running a 64 bit version of Mac OS. You must perform this update manually, as you had to do prior to the 4.0 series. This means downloading <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#mac">the DMG</a> and dragging the new 64 bit Tor Browser over your old Tor Browser, and replacing the application.</p>

<p>Once you are running the 64 bit version, updates should function correctly again.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>People are starting to ask us about a recent <a href="https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1545&amp;format=pdf">tech report</a> from Sambuddho&#39;s group about how an attacker with access to many routers around the Internet could gather the netflow logs from these routers and match up Tor flows. It&#39;s great to see more research on traffic correlation attacks, especially on attacks that don&#39;t need to see the whole flow on each side. But it&#39;s also important to realize that traffic correlation attacks are not a new area.</p>

<p>This blog post aims to give you some background to get you up to speed on the topic.</p>

<p>First, you should read the first few paragraphs of the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough">One cell is enough to break Tor&#39;s anonymity</a> analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, remember the basics of how Tor provides anonymity. Tor clients <a href="https://www.torproject.org/images/htw2.png">route their traffic</a> over several (<a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#VariablePathLength">usually three</a>) relays, with the goal that no single relay gets to learn both where the user is (call her Alice) and what site she&#39;s reaching (call it Bob).</p>

<p>The Tor design <a href="https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/design-paper/tor-design.html#subsec:threat-model">doesn&#39;t try to protect</a> against an attacker who can see or measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor network. That&#39;s because if you can see both flows, some <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#danezis:pet2004">simple statistics</a> let you decide whether they match up.</p>

<p>Because we aim to let people browse the web, we can&#39;t afford the extra overhead and hours of additional delay that are used in high-latency mix networks like <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#mixmaster-spec">Mixmaster</a> or <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#minion-design">Mixminion</a> to slow this attack. That&#39;s why Tor&#39;s security is all about trying to decrease the chances that an adversary will end up in the right positions to see the traffic flows.</p>

<p>The way we generally explain it is that Tor tries to protect against <strong>traffic analysis</strong>, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can&#39;t protect against <strong>traffic confirmation</strong> (also known as <strong>end-to-end correlation</strong>), where an attacker tries to confirm a hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math.</p>

<p>And the math is really effective. There are simple packet counting attacks (<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#SS03">Passive Attack Analysis for Connection-Based Anonymity Systems</a>) and moving window averages (<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#timing-fc2004">Timing Attacks in Low-Latency Mix-Based Systems</a>), but the more recent stuff is <a href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/05/28/sampled-traffic-analysis-by-internet-exchange-level-adversaries/">downright scary</a>, like Steven Murdoch&#39;s PET 2007 paper about achieving high confidence in a correlation attack despite seeing only 1 in 2000 packets on each side (<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#murdoch-pet2007">Sampled Traffic Analysis by Internet-Exchange-Level Adversaries</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, there&#39;s some further discussion about the efficacy of traffic correlation attacks at scale in the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters">Improving Tor&#39;s anonymity by changing guard parameters</a> analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tariq&#39;s paper makes two simplifying assumptions when calling an attack successful [...] 2) He assumes that the end-to-end correlation attack (matching up the incoming flow to the outgoing flow) is instantaneous and perfect. [...] The second one (&quot;how successful is the correlation attack at scale?&quot; or maybe better, &quot;how do the false positives in the correlation attack compare to the false negatives?&quot;) remains an open research question.</p>

<p>Researchers generally agree that given a handful of traffic flows, it&#39;s easy to match them up. But what about the millions of traffic flows we have now? What levels of false positives (algorithm says &quot;match!&quot; when it&#39;s wrong) are acceptable to this attacker? Are there some simple, not too burdensome, tricks we can do to drive up the false positives rates, even if we all agree that those tricks wouldn&#39;t work in the &quot;just looking at a handful of flows&quot; case?</p>

<p>More precisely, it&#39;s possible that correlation attacks don&#39;t scale well because as the number of Tor clients grows, the chance that the exit stream actually came from a different Tor client (not the one you&#39;re watching) grows. So the confidence in your match needs to grow along with that or your false positive rate will explode. The people who say that correlation attacks don&#39;t scale use phrases like &quot;say your correlation attack is 99.9% accurate&quot; when arguing it. The folks who think it does scale use phrases like &quot;I can easily make my correlation attack arbitrarily accurate.&quot; My hope is that the reality is somewhere in between — correlation attacks in the current Tor network can probably be made plenty accurate, but perhaps with some simple design changes we can improve the situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discussion of false positives is key to this new paper too: Sambuddho&#39;s paper mentions a false positive rate of 6%. That sounds like it means if you see a traffic flow at one side of the Tor network, and you have a set of 100000 flows on the other side and you&#39;re trying to find the match, then 6000 of those flows will look like a match. It&#39;s easy to see how at scale, this &quot;base rate fallacy&quot; problem could make the attack effectively useless.</p>

<p>And that high false positive rate is not at all surprising, since he is trying to capture only a summary of the flows at each side and then do the correlation using only those summaries. It would be neat (in a theoretical sense) to learn that it works, but it seems to me that there&#39;s a lot of work left here in showing that it would work in practice. It also seems likely that his definition of false positive rate and my use of it above don&#39;t line up completely: it would be great if somebody here could work on reconciling them.</p>

<p>For a possibly related case where a series of academic research papers misunderstood the base rate fallacy and came to bad conclusions, see <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks">Mike&#39;s critique of website fingerprinting attacks</a> plus the <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Esa499/papers/ccs-webfp-final.pdf">follow-up paper from CCS this year confirming that he&#39;s right</a>.</p>

<p>I should also emphasize that whether this attack can be performed at all has to do with how much of the Internet the adversary is able to measure or control. This diversity question is a large and important one, with lots of attention already. See <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters#fix4">more discussion here</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, it&#39;s great to see more research on traffic confirmation attacks, but a) traffic confirmation attacks are not a new area so don&#39;t freak out without actually reading the papers, and b) this particular one, while kind of neat, doesn&#39;t supercede all the previous papers.</p>

<p>(I should put in an addendum here for the people who are wondering if everything they read on the Internet in a given week is surely all tied together: we don&#39;t have any reason to think that this attack, or one like it, is related to the recent arrests of <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous">a few dozen people</a> around the world. So far, all indications are that those arrests are best explained by bad opsec for a few of them, and then those few pointed to the others when they were questioned.)</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Welcome to the forty-fifth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Mozilla announces Polaris Privacy Initiative</h1>

<p>Mozilla, makers of the Firefox browser upon which Tor Browser is based, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2014/11/10/introducing-polaris-privacy-initiative-to-accelerate-user-focused-privacy-online">announced</a> a series of projects to “accelerate pragmatic and user-focused advances in privacy technology for the Web, giving users more control, awareness and protection in their Web experiences”. The Tor Project is one of Mozilla’s two partners in this Polaris Privacy Initiative, and the collaboration will involve looking at the Firefox codebase to see if its relationship to Tor Browser and the Tor development process can be made more efficient, giving Tor engineers more time to focus on other important issues. Mozilla also stated their intention to run several high-capacity Tor middle relays, contributing to a faster and more stable Tor network.</p>

<p>As Andrew Lewman <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/partnering-mozilla">wrote</a> on the Tor blog, “the Tor Browser is one of the best ways to protect privacy on the web and this partnership is a huge step in advancing people’s right to freedom of expression online”. Watch for more announcements as work on these two fronts continues.</p>

<h1>Tor and Operation Onymous</h1>

<p>An international coalition of law enforcement authorities <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/global-action-against-dark-markets-tor-network">announced</a> the seizure of over 400 Tor hidden services allegedly engaging in illegal activity. Once the desired headlines had been written, something approaching the facts began to emerge, with the claimed number of seized services <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/oops-we-counted-wrong-silk-road-dark-net-tor/">dropping sharply to 27</a>; more troublingly, several high-capacity Tor relays with no apparent connection to the hidden services were <a href="https://blog.torservers.net/20141109/three-servers-offline-likely-seized.html">also</a> <a href="https://raided4tor.wordpress.com/">seized</a>. However, in contrast to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">last major takedown of hidden services</a>, which involved one shared hidden service hosting platform, there was no obvious single feature linking all of the seized sites, leading to concern in the Tor community that an exploit against the Tor network may have been responsible for their discovery.</p>

<p>It could be that these services were deanonymized individually over a period of months using a variety of means, then all seized at once for maximum effect: as Andrew Lewman and others wrote in a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous">response</a> posted to the Tor blog, these methods could include operational security mistakes by service operators, exploitation of flaws in poorly-written website code, or attacks on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency that is widely used on hidden service marketplaces. On the other hand, if an attack on the Tor network itself is at play, it may be a variant of the class of attack known as “traffic confirmation”, like the one <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-August/000057.html">observed earlier this year</a>. “Unfortunately,” as the blog post notes, ”the authorities did not specify how they managed to locate the hidden services”; even if they had, recent disclosures concerning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">“parallel construction” in law enforcement</a> mean that the public would not necessarily be able to trust their explanation.</p>

<p>“Hidden services need some love” has become a familiar refrain in recent months, and even though the story behind these seizures may remain unknown, they have reinvigorated some long-running threads on improvements to the security of this important technology. George Kadianakis <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007730.html">coded</a> a patch that allows hidden service operators to “specify a set of nodes that will be pinned as middle nodes in hidden service rendezvous circuits”, while the theory behind this <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007726.html">continues to be discussed</a>, as does the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007735.html">hidden service authorization feature</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007744.html">how widely it is used in practice</a>.</p>

<p>“The attention hidden services have received is minimal compared to their social value and compared to the size and determination of their adversaries.” If you are a hidden service operator concerned by these seizures, or you want to help ensure the possibility of free and uncensorable publishing online, see the group blog post for more details, and feel free to join in with the discussions on the tor-dev mailing list.</p>

<h1>More monthly status reports for October 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of October continued, with reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000693.html">Isis Lovecruft</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000694.html">Nicolas Vigier</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000695.html">Damian Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000696.html">Karsten Loesing</a>.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000697.html">SponsorF</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Arturo Filastò <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ooni-bridge-reachability-study-and-hackfest">reported</a> on OONI’s ongoing study of Tor bridge reachability in different countries, and the recent hackfest on the same topic.</p>

<p>Karsten Loesing offered an <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/onionoo-announce/2014/000002.html">update</a> on developments in the world of Onionoo, including new mirrors and search improvements.</p>

<h1>Help desk round up</h1>

<p>The help desk has been asked how to run Tor Browser on a Chromebook. ChromeOS does not allow any programs to be executed except Google Chrome, including other browsers like Tor Browser. The workaround for this is to install a Debian or Ubuntu environment within ChromeOS using <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a>. Once crouton is ready, Tor Browser for Linux can be downloaded and installed in the Debian or Ubuntu environment. Crouton users should seek support from the crouton team and not from the Tor help desk.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2014/11/10/introducing-polaris-privacy-initiative-to-accelerate-user-focused-privacy-online/">announced</a> that the Tor Project and the <a href="https://cdt.org">Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a> will be part of their new privacy initiative called Polaris, a collaboration to bring even more privacy features into Mozilla’s products. We are honored to be working alongside Mozilla as well as the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology to give Firefox users more options to protect their privacy.</p>

<h1>Why Mozilla?</h1>

<p>Mozilla is an industry leader in developing features to support the user’s desire for increased privacy online and shares the Tor Project&#39;s mission of helping people protect their security online. At the core of Mozilla&#39;s values is the belief that individuals’ privacy cannot be treated as optional. We share this belief. Millions of people around the world rely on the protection of the Tor software and network to safeguard their anonymity. We appreciate companies like Mozilla that see the importance of safeguarding privacy. The Tor volunteer network has grown to the point that large companies can usefully contribute without hurting network diversity. The Tor network will get even better with Mozilla&#39;s help, and we hope that their participation will encourage even more organizations to join us.</p>

<p>The initial projects with Mozilla will focus on two areas:</p>

<h2>Engineering support: </h2>

<p>The Tor Browser is built on the Firefox platform and we are excited to have the resources of Mozilla’s engineers to help us merge the many Firefox privacy fixes into the Mozilla codebase. The increased attention from Mozilla will give us time to focus on finding and fixing new issues rather than maintaining our fork.</p>

<h2>Network Support:</h2>

<p>Tor&#39;s network size constrains the number of users that can use Tor concurrently. In the short term, Mozilla will help address this by hosting high-capacity Tor middle relays to make Tor’s network more responsive and allow Tor to serve more users.</p>

<p>We believe that the Tor Browser is one of the best ways to protect privacy on the web and this partnership is a huge step in advancing people’s right to freedom of expression online.</p>
