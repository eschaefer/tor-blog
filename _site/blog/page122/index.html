	      <p>Tor 0.2.1.13-alpha includes another big pile of minor bugfixes and
cleanups. We&#39;re finally getting close to a release candidate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download">https://www.torproject.org/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.13-alpha - 2009-03-09
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Correctly update the list of which countries we exclude as
exits, when the GeoIP file is loaded or reloaded. Diagnosed by
lark. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x and earlier):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically detect MacOSX versions earlier than 10.4.0, and
disable kqueue from inside Tor when running with these versions.
We previously did this from the startup script, but that was no
help to people who didn&#39;t use the startup script. Resolves bug 863.</li>
<li>When we had picked an exit node for a connection, but marked it as
&quot;optional&quot;, and it turned out we had no onion key for the exit,
stop wanting that exit and try again. This situation may not
be possible now, but will probably become feasible with proposal

<ol>
<li>Spotted by rovv. Fixes another case of bug 752.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Clients no longer cache certificates for authorities they do not
recognize. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.</li>
<li>When we can&#39;t transmit a DNS request due to a network error, retry
it after a while, and eventually transmit a failing response to
the RESOLVED cell. Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha.</li>
<li>If the controller claimed responsibility for a stream, but that
stream never finished making its connection, it would live
forever in circuit_wait state. Now we close it after SocksTimeout
seconds. Bugfix on 0.1.2.7-alpha; reported by Mike Perry.</li>
<li>Drop begin cells to a hidden service if they come from the middle
of a circuit. Patch from lark.</li>
<li>When we erroneously receive two EXTEND cells for the same circuit
ID on the same connection, drop the second. Patch from lark.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that occurs on exit nodes when a nameserver request
timed out. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; our CLEAR debugging code had
been suppressing the bug since 0.1.2.10-alpha. Partial fix for
bug 929.</li>
<li>Do not assume that a stack-allocated character array will be
64-bit aligned on platforms that demand that uint64_t access is
aligned. Possible fix for bug 604.</li>
<li>Parse dates and IPv4 addresses in a locale- and libc-independent
manner, to avoid platform-dependent behavior on malformed input.</li>
<li>Build correctly when configured to build outside the main source
path. Patch from Michael Gold.</li>
<li>We were already rejecting relay begin cells with destination port
of 0. Now also reject extend cells with destination port or address
of 0. Suggested by lark.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t re-extend introduction circuits if we ran out of RELAY_EARLY
cells. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha. Fixes more of bug 878.</li>
<li>If we&#39;re an exit node, scrub the IP address to which we are exiting
in the logs. Bugfix on 0.2.1.8-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On Linux, use the prctl call to re-enable core dumps when the user
is option is set.</li>
<li>New controller event NEWCONSENSUS that lists the networkstatus
lines for every recommended relay. Now controllers like Torflow
can keep up-to-date on which relays they should be using.</li>
<li>Update to the &quot;February 26 2009&quot; ip-to-country file.</li>
</ul>

	      <p><strong>New releases, new hires, new funding</strong>
On February 8, we released versions 0.2.0.34-stable and 0.2.1.12-alpha.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.34 features several more security-related fixes. You should upgrade, especially if you run an exit relay (remote crash) or a directory authority (remote infinite loop), or you&#39;re on an older (pre-XP) or not-recently-patched Windows (remote exploit).</p>

<p>This release marks end-of-life for Tor 0.1.2.x. Those Tor versions have many known flaws, and nobody should be using them. You should upgrade. If you&#39;re using a Linux or BSD and its packages are obsolete, stop using those packages and upgrade anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancements</strong>
In Tor 0.2.1.12-alpha, if we&#39;re using bridges and our network goes away, be more willing to forgive our bridges and try again when we get an application request. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</p>

<p>Continued to develop research and coding items for improving Tor&#39;s performance using a number of techniques. We&#39;re focusing on six main reasons for slow performance: congestion control, tcp backoff, wrong window sizes at start, lack of priority for circuit control cells, and user load from peer to peer bulk data transfers.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve implemented KDE Marble as an alternate visualization of the world into Vidalia. The first phase is to get a better 3-D globe for clients. The next phase is to enable “click to exit” so users can choose their country of preference for exit nodes. More on this coming in a future blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Outreach</strong>
Andrew and Roger attended an Open Society Institute Forum on, “The Future of Freedom and Control in the Internet Age”, <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/fellowship/events/freedom_20090210" title="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/fellowship/events/freedom\_20090210">http://www.soros.org/initiatives/fellowship/events/freedom_20090210</a>. Rebecca MacKinnon and Evgeny Morozov both mentioned Tor and its positive uses multiple times during the talk and subsequent Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Andrew attended Mobile Activism 4 Change barcamp on February 21. This generated some citizen media press about security, privacy, and anonymity in reference to the mobile activist world. You can read more at <a href="http://barcamp.org/MobileTechForSocialChangeNewYork" title="http://barcamp.org/MobileTechForSocialChangeNewYork">http://barcamp.org/MobileTechForSocialChangeNewYork</a>.</p>

<p>Jacob attended the InfoActivism camp, <a href="http://www.informationactivism.org/" title="http://www.informationactivism.org/">http://www.informationactivism.org/</a>, in Bangalore, India. He gave 20 presentations, trainings, and lectures on Tor.</p>

<p>Produced a guide to Tor and circumvention with the Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Saudi Arabia, <a href="http://cdhr.info" title="http://cdhr.info">http://cdhr.info</a>.</p>

<p>Worked with Global Voices ( <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/" title="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">http://globalvoicesonline.org/</a>) to update their guide to anonymous blogging with Tor and Wordpress; <a href="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/" title="http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/">http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/projects/guide/</a>. We recommend the Tor Browser Bundle by default, and provide clearer instructions and more pictures to assist users in getting configured quickly and securely.</p>

<p>There was a talk at BlackHat from Xinwen Fu. Our official response and thoughts on the topic are available at <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough</a></p>

<p>From Feb 6-9, Roger, Nick, Wendy, and Andrew attended ShmooconV, <a href="http://shmoocon.org/" title="http://shmoocon.org/">http://shmoocon.org/</a>, in February. Discussed Tor present and futures with many of the attendees.</p>

<p>End of Feb, Steven and Roger went to Financial Crypto 2009. We talked more with economics and &quot;economics of information security&quot; professors and researchers to get a better intuition about how to balance usability and load on the network. Steven also did a lightning talk on the &quot;TLS footprint&quot; arms race question: should we wait to fix known flaws, to slow down the arms race, or should we fix everything asap to discourage the censors from even trying?</p>

<p>Feb 17, Roger did a guest lecture on Tor in Drexel&#39;s senior-level computer
security class.</p>

<p>In Feb we also met with the Freedom House ( <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/" title="http://www.freedomhouse.org/">http://www.freedomhouse.org/</a>), to help them understand how Tor works and to try to help with the trainings they&#39;re organizing.</p>

<p>Jillian C. York continued her blogging for Tor at KnightPulse with “From Tunisia to Japan: Anonymity Everywhere”, <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/02/25/tunisia-japan-anonymity-everywhere" title="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/02/25/tunisia-japan-anonymity-everywhere">http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/09/02/25/tunisia-japan-anonymity-everywh...</a></p>

<p><strong>Tor bundles for USB drives or LiveCDs</strong>
On February 18, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.9 with an updated Tor version to 0.2.1.12-alpha, Vidalia updated to 0.1.11, and Firefox 3.0.6. Andrew has taken over building the bundle to reduce the time between tor releases and bundles which include it. This should make PETER from the blog happy.</p>

<p>Updated the Incognito LiveCD TODO list to provide some more direction and tasks for the near future, <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Feb-2009/msg00056.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Feb-2009/msg00056.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Feb-2009/msg00056.html</a></p>

<p>We continued development and enhancement of TorVM with software updates to libevent, openwrt, vidalia, openvpn, tor, and win pcap. Enhanced the self-extraction and build scripts for easier creation by less technical users.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, and efficiency</strong>
We wrote up a summary of directory overhead work here:
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/overhead-directory-info%3A-past%2C-present%2C-future" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/overhead-directory-info%3A-past%2C-present%2C-future">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/overhead-directory-info%3A-past%2C-pres...</a></p>

<p>Csaba Kiraly has been doing research on how to reduce the overall load on the Tor network, while also reducing latency for clients: <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Feb-2009/msg00000.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Feb-2009/msg00000.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Feb-2009/msg00000.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Alternate acquisition methods</strong>
Updated our get-tor email auto-responder to include more languages, added in the English version of the tor browser bundle, tested gmail download and resuming interrupted downloads, and fleshed out the design for easier localization of the message text and commands.</p>

<p><strong>Translation</strong>
We had a combined 113 commits across Polish, Chinese, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian, Argentinian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Romanian languages. 41 of these commits were through our translation portal.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>As we started preparing to apply for the Google Summer of Code 2009, we realized that we haven&#39;t reported how last year&#39;s Summer of Code went for us.</p>

<p>Tor&#39;s 2008 Google Summer of Code was a victim of Tor&#39;s increasing growth! We&#39;ve got a lot more people involved now, and we have a lot more projects we want to tackle. But that also means we need to work harder at coordinating everything, and that&#39;s not as smooth as we&#39;d hoped.</p>

<p>Tor had the luxury to receive seven slots for students. GSoC 2008 overall, was a success; as the students and projects contributed a lot to the Tor project. Also, here I am, a former GSoC student writing a blog post for the project.</p>

<p>Below is an overview over the GSoC 2008 projects and a summary of their results.</p>

<p><em>Domenik Bork: Configuration of Hidden Services with User Authorization in Vidalia</em>
Support for creating hidden services using a GUI was lacking from <a href="http://vidalia-project.net">Vidalia</a>, making it very hard for Vidalia users to correctly set up their own. It was necessary to change Tor&#39;s configuration file manually, and many users are overwhelmed by the task of even locating that file. Domenik created a new tab in the Vidalia settings to allow the creation and configuration of hidden services, and worked on the necessary UI changes to allow the creation of the new hidden services with user authorization (currently available only in alpha versions of Tor). As soon as the next stable Tor version lands, users will be able to set up their hidden services with user authorization with more convenience.</p>

<p><em>Fallon Chen: Improving Tor Path Selection</em>
When Tor decides on a path for a new circuit, many factors come into play. Currently, latency does not factor into the equation a whole lot, but it is really important for the user experience. On the other hand, always choosing the fastest connection will harm anonymity. Fallon tried to find a model to reduce circuit establishment times, without affecting anonymity too much. During her project, she gathered a lot of data that helps shaping the current development of Tor. She discovered that a Pareto distribution is a good model for Tor circuit establishing times. Unfortunately, she had to quit working before much actual code could be produced; nevertheless, her research is the basis for the current development of Tor&#39;s path selection. She was also involved in the writing of <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/151-path-selection-improvements.txt">proposal 151</a>, which Mike Perry is currently implementing. The goal of the proposal is to allow Tor clients to automatically detect useful values for configuration options depending on the user&#39;s environment (mobile satellite connection vs. broadband, or changing conditions).</p>

<p><em>Aleksei Gorny: Tor Exit Scanner Improvements</em>
To prevent exit nodes from maliciously (or unintentionally) interfering with traffic passed through them, we have <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torflow/trunk/NetworkScanners/README.ExitScanning">SoaT (Snakes on a Tor)</a> to automatically detect nodes that misbehave. It was Aleksei&#39;s task to extend SoaT to make it more useful, especially to make it execute tests automatically, so that eventually directory authorities can use its input to flag bad nodes appropriately. The result of the project is the foundation of our ongoing work there, and a functional version exists to be evaluated now.</p>

<p><em>Sebastian Hahn: Extending PuppeTor</em>
During my project, I worked on extending <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/puppetor/master/">PuppeTor</a> to allow forming virtual networks that can run centrally coordinated tests (similar to buildbot, except with a test suite). I produced a version that allows basic tests to be run, but the API became incompatible with the pre-existing PuppeTor. Also, in its state immediately after the summer of code, writing tests was rather more difficult than with the original version. After the summer, we decided that there should be no two different versions of PuppeTor, and I continue to do work on top of the version produced during the summer. It will eventually be deployed as the new PuppeTor and used for regression testing as well as performance/anonymity evaluations. One of the specific challenges that both student and mentor learned from here was a lack of communication about what the result should look like. I ended up developing something that wasn&#39;t what some of the developers had originally envisioned, which caused quite a bit of extra work.</p>

<p><em>Simon Johansson: A Translation wiki for our website</em>
The Tor Project has been working over the past year to set up web-based tools to help volunteers translate our applications into other languages. We finally hit upon <a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/index">Pootle</a>, and we have a fine <a href="https://translation.torproject.org/">web-based translation engine</a> in place for Vidalia, Torbutton, and Torcheck. However, Pootle only translates strings that are in the &quot;po&quot; format, and our website uses <a href="https://www.torproject.org/translation">wml files</a>. Simon&#39;s project was to come up with a way to convert our wml files into po strings and back, so they could be handled by Pootle. Unfortunately, communication between Simon and his mentor didn&#39;t happen often enough, and in the end we got very little useful work out of this project. Nevertheless, many components of the Tor project can now be <a href="https://www.torproject.org/translation-overview">translated by using Pootle</a>.</p>

<p><em>Camilo Viecco: Providing Blossom functionality to Vidalia</em>
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/blossom/trunk/">Blossom</a> allows to choose that the user prefers to exit from a specific country. The same can be achieved by manually changing Tor&#39;s configuration file, but Vidalia, our Tor configuration tool, did not have a way to easily let users select a country to exit from. Camilo&#39;s task was to integrate this functionality into Vidalia, so that mainstream users can benefit without needing to figure out how to use Blossom. During his work, a completely functional branch was created that can be used to achieve the goals. Due to some changes in the Vidalia UI, his work couldn&#39;t be merged into mainline Vidalia completely. Instead, his back-end changes will be cherry-picked into mainline as soon as the UI work is finished.</p>

<p><em>Christian Wilms: Performance Enhancing Measures for Tor Hidden Services</em>
Hidden services are a very useful feature in Tor that allows anyone to host a location-hidden service. Unfortunately, accessing them is often a rather slow process. Based on a <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#loesing2008performance">paper</a> that he and Karsten Loesing had written, Christian started out by measuring connection times to hidden services under various conditions. He found and fixed quite a few bugs in the process. During the remainder of the summer, Christian worked on a larger-scale change to reduce connection times, and his work could be used as a basis for a later patch to fix the remaining issues.</p>

<p>The summary is that Tor took too many students last summer; as overall we were about 50% successful with project completion. Better mentoring, including being stricter with students and weekly progress reports, could have been very helpful for our students. I experienced it myself: towards the end of the summer I still had a lot of stuff on my plate that I needed to rush through. By having fewer students and better communication between mentors and students, and involving students more with the Tor project as a whole, we should be able to get even more out of the next summer, if Google invites us to participate again. Maybe the next GSoC blog post will be written by a GSoC 2009 student?</p>

<p>As a last note, next time around we plan to work more closely with the <a href="https://www.eff.org">EFF</a> (our sponsor organization for GSoC). In particular, we&#39;d like to accept a few students to work with Peter Eckersley on Switzerland and other projects organized by EFF&#39;s engineers.</p>

          <div class="post-description">
	      <p>The Berkman Center has released their report on the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/2007_Circumvention_Landscape_Report">landscape of circumvention technologies</a> as it was in 2007. Tor was included in this test and comes out as a secure tool with some improvements needed. Technology Review also picked up this report and <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/web/22252/page1/">wrote an article</a> on the results.</p>

<p>Since the original publication of the report, we&#39;ve responded to and improved a number of identified weaknesses. The main focus has been on usability of the software. Tor is easier to understand, configure, and install. We&#39;ve worked on finding translators for the various parts of the suite of tools that comprise Tor. We developed and enhanced a Firefox plugin called Torbutton. The current Torbutton mitigates all known browser-based anonymity attacks. Torbutton is included in our bundles and is automatically installed into the user&#39;s Firefox browser configuration. Torbutton can be found at <a href="https://torproject.org/torbutton/" title="https://torproject.org/torbutton/">https://torproject.org/torbutton/</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275</a>.</p>

<p>In response to the demand for portability and ease of use, we created the Tor Browser Bundle. The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, or any portable media, and comes with a pre-configured web browser and is self contained. The Tor IM Browser Bundle additionally allows instant messaging and chat. The bundle contains the Tor controller Vidalia, a portable version of Firefox, a caching http proxy called Polipo, the instant messaging client Pidgin with Off The Record client to client encryption for secure chats, and of course, the Tor proxy software. The Tor Browser Bundle can be found at <a href="https://torproject.org/torbrowser/" title="https://torproject.org/torbrowser/">https://torproject.org/torbrowser/</a>.</p>

<p>There is an arms race between censors and circumvention tools. We&#39;ve developed a number of features to prepare for the next few steps in this race. Some of these features involve the ability to use non-public relays and normalization of the Tor traffic to allow those in content denied environments the ability to continue to reach the information and communities they need. Much more research and experimentation needs to occur in the next few years to further enhance these features.</p>

<p>As part of its dedication to transparency and openness, The Tor Project has published its three year development roadmap, focused on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies. While Tor&#39;s original goal was to provide online anonymity, many people around the world use Tor to get around Internet censorship, as well. Human Rights Watch and Global Voices Online have both recommended Tor as a tool to circumvent censorship regimes in oppressive nations. The roadmap is focused on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies. This roadmap can be found at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release" title="https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release">https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release</a>.</p>
