        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Around midnight on August 4th we were notified by a few people that a large number of hidden service addresses have disappeared from the Tor Network. There are a variety of rumors about a hosting company for hidden services: that it is suddenly offline, has been breached, or attackers have placed a javascript exploit on their web site.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">Hidden service</a> is a server – often delivering web pages – that is reachable only through the Tor network. While most people know that the Tor network with its thousands of volunteer-run nodes provides anonymity for users who don´t want to be tracked and identified on the internet, the lesser-known hidden service feature of Tor provides anonymity also for the server operator.</p>

<p>Anyone can run hidden services, and many do. We use them internally at The Tor Project to offer our developers anonymous access to services such as SSH, IRC, HTTP, and our bug tracker. Other organizations run hidden services to protect dissidents, activists, and protect the anonymity of users trying to find help for suicide prevention, domestic violence, and abuse-recovery. Whistleblowers and journalists use hidden services to exchange information in a secure and anonymous way and publish critical information in a way that is not easily traced back to them. The New Yorker&#39;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/strongbox/">Strongbox</a> is one public example.</p>

<p>Hidden service addresses, aka the dot onion domain, are cryptographically and automatically generated by the tor software. They look like this <a href="http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/">http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/</a>, which is our torproject.org website as a hidden service.</p>

<p>There is no central repository nor registry of addresses. The dot onion address is both the name and routing address for the services hosted at the dot onion. The Tor network uses the .onion-address to direct requests to the hidden server and route back the data from the hidden server to the anonymous user. The design of the Tor network ensures that the user can not know where the server is located and the server can not find out the IP-address of the user, except by intentional malicious means like hidden tracking code embedded in the web pages delivered by the server. Additionally, the design of the Tor network, which is run by thousands of volunteers, ensures that it is impossible to censor or block certain .onion-addresses.</p>

<p>The person, or persons, who run Freedom Hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to The Tor Project, Inc., the organization coordinating the development of the Tor software and research. In the past, adversarial organizations have skipped trying to break Tor hidden services and instead attacked the software running at the server behind the dot onion address. Exploits for PHP, Apache, MySQL, and other software are far more common than exploits for Tor. The current news indicates that someone has exploited the software behind Freedom Hosting. From what is known so far, the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of javascript exploit in the web pages delivered to users. This exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect user&#39;s computers. The malware payload could be trying to exploit potential bugs in Firefox 17 ESR, on which our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser">Tor Browser</a> is based. We&#39;re investigating these bugs and will fix
them if we can.</p>

<p>As for now, one of multiple hidden service hosting companies appears to be down. There are lots of rumors and speculation as to what&#39;s happened. We&#39;re reading the same news and threads you are and don&#39;t have any insider information. We&#39;ll keep you updated as details become available.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> See our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-old-tor-browser-bundles-vulnerable">next blog post</a> for more details about the attack.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the 5<sup>th</sup> issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the busy Tor community.</p>

<h1>Summer Developer Meeting Wrap-up</h1>

<p>The 2013 summer Tor development meeting happened at the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">Technische Universität München</a>. There were no formal talks during the meeting itself, but <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:050322-tumuenchen-parabeln.jpg">slides were still involved</a>!</p>

<p>New minutes from sessions to add to those covered in the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-july-24th-2013">last edition</a> have been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting">posted to the wiki</a>. This includes a second discussion on <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/PluggableTransports1">Pluggable Transports</a>, the role of the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/ResearchDirector">Research Director</a>, a summary of discussions with cryptographers Tanja Lange and djb about the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/TorCrypto">cryptographic aspects of Tor</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/Timesheets">timesheets for Tor contractors</a> and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/MailingLists">mailing-lists</a>.</p>

<p>Christian Grothoff organized a talk with Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum at the university. Their initial topic was the censorship arms race, but given the up-to-date knowledge of the students and other attendees, the talk got turned into a marathon 4-hour long Q&amp;A session! Thanks to Christian, the <a href="https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum-video">video is available</a> from the GNUnet website.</p>

<p>The following day was dedicated to more concrete hands-on discussions and coding. The public hackfest was well-attended, with more than 70 people focusing on everything to do with Tor. Some attendees had even traveled several hundred kilometers to be there! Discussions popped up everywhere, code was written and some newcomers were introduced to the many elements that make up the Tor project. Thanks to everyone who showed up!</p>

<h1>Comparing handshake protocols for Tor: Ace vs ntor</h1>

<p>In WPES ’12, Esfandiar Mohammadi and Aniket Kate <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-August/003901.html">introduced</a> <a href="http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/%7Emohammadi/paper/owake.pdf">Ace, an alternative for Tor’s current handshake protocol ntor</a>.</p>

<p>Ace was already <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005163.html">discussed on tor-dev at the end of 2012</a>, “but back then, no implementation for the double scalar multiplication operation (a * b + c * d) on Curve25519 was available. But recently, Robert Ransom implemented in his <a href="http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/%7Emohammadi/ace/celator.tar.gz">celator library</a> a highly efficient double scalar multiplication which is suitable for our handshake protocol Ace”, wrote Esfandiar.</p>

<p>From the comparative benchmarks that Shivanker Goel implemented and ran, using Ace could improve speed and CPU load compared to the current ntor implementation. Esfandiar Mohammadi’s email on tor-talk contains the methodology, remarks and concrete numbers.</p>

<p>The code for the <a href="http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/%7Emohammadi/ace/ace-benchmarks.tar.gz">benchmark is available online</a> along with a <a href="http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/%7Emohammadi/ace/ace-handshake.txt">Tor-style proposal or improving circuit-creation key exchange using Ace</a>.</p>

<h1>New Globe web application to explore the Tor network</h1>

<p>Christian made his <a href="http://globe.rndm.de/">Globe web application available</a> at a new location. Globe is quite similar to <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org">Atlas</a>, and in fact uses the same data, but it also allows searching for bridges and is slightly more user-friendly.</p>

<p>Globe now uses dygraphs as a graphing engine which makes it even easier to select time intervals for its graphs. Feel free to try out Globe and give feedback on <a href="https://github.com/makepanic/globe/issues">its bug tracker</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor at OHM2013 — Netherlands</h1>

<p>Several members of the Tor community will be at OHM2013: Observe, Hack, Make: “A five day outdoor international camping festival for hackers, makers, and those with an inquisitive mind”, according to <a href="https://ohm2013.org/">their website</a>. The event starts tomorrow with a few Tor-related meetings and activities.</p>

<p>Tom Lowenthal will be holding a <a href="https://program.ohm2013.org/event/307.html">social event</a> at the Noisy Square village for Tor contributors and relay operators on August, 1st at 14:00.</p>

<p>Later that day, Tom will also go through “the development work, advocacy help, coordination, system administration, outreach, community support, and other <a href="https://program.ohm2013.org/event/305.html">things that you can do to help the Tor Project</a> grow and improve” in the Lovelace Tent at 22:00.</p>

<p>Fabio Pietrosanti invited anyone interested to attend the <a href="https://program.ohm2013.org/event/256.html">Tor2Web meeting</a> to: “outlook what we’ve done, how the network growth up discussing which could be the next major milestones to be reached in terms of software, network development, community involvement and fundraising.”</p>

<p>Last but not least, Moritz Bartl from torservers.net will be around with Tor stickers and posters, as well as collecting donations to create new exit nodes. Look around the <a href="https://noisysquare.com/">Noisy Square</a>!</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>GSoC students sent out a new round of status reports. Johannes Fürmann had made great progress on the framework for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005179.html">EvilGenius</a> — a way to simulate censorship events: “The Genius is there, all we have to do now is make it more evil.”</p>

<p>Cristian-Matei Toader is moving forward on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005180.html">limiting the set of allowed system calls by the tor daemon</a>.</p>

<p>ra_ sucessfully now has a “rttprober” script to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005181.html">measure the RTT of Tor circuits</a>.</p>

<p>Kostas Jakeliunas has a clean code base for the Tor Metrics Archive project that can import archival data and be queried with an Onionoo-like interface.</p>

<p>Hareesan did a quick report on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005185.html">steganography browser extension</a>.</p>

<p>Chang Lan Status has returned to report some progress on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005193.html">HTTP pluggable transport</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/onionoo.git/commit/1c1dfa48">Karsten Loesing added a new “fields” parameter to Onionoo</a>. It can be used to restrict the response size when only a specific set of attributes are needed. This feature is used by the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html">bubble graphs</a> showing diversity of the Tor network wrote by Lunar. The latter are now available on the metrics website, thanks to Karsten.</p>

<p>Kevin P Dyer released <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005194.html">Format-Transforming Encryption Pluggable Transport version v0.1.2-alpha</a>. Source code, documentation and builds are available on the <a href="https://kpdyer.com/fte/">FTE website</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005209.html">Damian Johnson has released two new monitoring scripts</a> based on the remote descriptor fetching support recently added to <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">Stem</a>: one to check for malformed content in the descriptors, the other to monitor sudden influxes of new relays (potential Sybil attacks).</p>

<h1>Summer Development Meeting 2013</h1>

<p>About 40 core Tor contributors gathered over July 22-23 at the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">Technische Universität München</a> in Germany for <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting">this year&#39;s Summer Development Meeting</a>. That&#39;s quite a number, and as could be expected, there are a huge number of topics up for discussion — the brainstorming session generated around 150. Gunner from <a href="http://aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration Tech</a> is once again facilitating the meeting, helping everyone focus on the most pressing issues.</p>

<p>Rough notes from some of the break-out sessions are now up on the wiki. A list of the topics and a brief summary of the discussions are given below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/LoveForVolunteers">Love for volunteers</a>: strategies for outreach and long-term support; identifying where they&#39;re most needed</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/PluggableTransports0">Censorship and pluggable transports</a>: documenting the now-large number of pluggable transports; discussing countries&#39; differing censorship strategies</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/Fundraising">Fundraising</a>: funding outlook seems to be positive, although diversity in funding sources is needed to reduce dependency on single institutions like the US Government</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/WebsiteTranslation">Website Translation</a>: notes from a discussion which led to the definition of a new translation review process and a list of actionables</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/ServiceInfrastructure">Service infrastructure</a>: multiple fundamental services could use some more love: GetTor (TBB by email), website, Trac, check.tp.org, BridgeDB; shutting down unmaintained services</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/OpSec">Operational security</a>: random notes on OpSec for Tor people</li>
</ul>

<p>On the sidelines of the dev meeting, Roger and Jake are doing a public talk on the topic of <a href="https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum">Tor and the Censorship Arms Race</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to meet people who spend their day making Tor a reality, you can <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/join-us-tor-hack-day-munich-germany">join them for a public hack day</a> on Friday, July 26, 2013. Bring your ideas, questions, projects, and technical expertise with you!</p>

<h1>Remote descriptor fetching in Stem</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005156.html">Damian Johnson announced</a> having implemented remote descriptor fetching in <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">Stem</a>, a feature to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-May/004924.html">migrate more metrics measurement tools to Python</a>. “Its usage is pleasantly simple” wrote Damian. See for yourself in the <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/api/descriptor/remote.html">excellent documentation</a>!</p>

<h1>Orbot 12.0.1 call for beta testing</h1>

<p>After a long interval, Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029063.html">announced the release of a new version of Orbot</a> — a client for the Tor network on Android mobile devices. For Orbot 12.0.1, the developers have “switched versioning styles to a simpler major.minor.bugfix model”, wrote Nathan.</p>

<p>He continues with a call for testing: “Since we haven&#39;t done a release in a while, and we have some new build tools, I mostly want to make sure I have not done something terribly wrong in the build process. Please confirm back if you are able to successfully use this release.”</p>

<p>Updates in 12.0.1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated to Tor 0.2.4.15-RC</li>
<li>flashy screen bug fixed now shows traffic</li>
<li>Stats in notification area</li>
<li>better handling of preference settings</li>
<li>Changes added superuser permission for Cyanogen</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk">download and start testing this release</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>Lunar reported on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000292.html">trip to Brussels for LSM 2013</a>. To sum it up, “people are really supportive of what we do these days”.</p>

<p>anonym outlined the <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003292.html">release schedule for Tails 0.20</a>.</p>

<p>intrigeri announced that <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003297.html">Tails has switched to a more conventional task manager</a>. It might now be easier for you to see what needs to be done. Have a look at the current list of 496 <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues">open issues</a>, there might be something waiting just for you.</p>

<p>Tor developers would love to find an easier way to debug tor when the daemon crashes. Nick Mathewson came up with an initial piece of code that could (when complete) <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9299">dump stack traces</a> on assertion, crash, or general trouble to the logs. There&#39;s more work to be done before it can be merged in Tor. Feel free to help — especially if you know how to do this on Windows or BSD.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson along with Andrea created a wiki page for <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/025/TicketTriage025">initial 0.2.5 series ticket triage</a>. If you have your own agenda for 0.2.5, you should be talking to them now!</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005158.html">Kostas Jakeliunas reported on their GSoC project</a> about producing a searchable metrics archive.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000291.html">Arturo reported</a> on his activities on Ooni probe in June.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005161.html">Pierre Lalet announced</a> that he started working on an implementation of the Tor protocol in Python. The intent is to have an independent implementation to test Tor. As the author puts it, &quot;the purpose is NOT to implement a secure or robust implementation that could be an alternative to Tor.&quot; Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/cea-sec/TorPylle">the code</a>: &quot;Comments, fixes and questions welcome!&quot;</p>

          <p>Welcome to the third issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the amazing Tor community.</p>

<h1>Last call for testing Tor 0.2.4 branch</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028934.html">Roger Dingledine notified tor-talk</a> that there are <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#Download-torbrowserbundlealpha">new versions of the Tor Browser Bundle</a>, dubbed 2.4.15-beta-1, that are ready to be tested: “If all goes well, we‘ll be calling the Tor 0.2.4 branch stable very soon. So now is the perfect time to let us know that it broke for you.”</p>

<p>He also added “to be clear, it is the Tor part of the Tor Browser Bundle that needs testing. We know there are a growing pile of bugs in Vidalia, as well as a set of issues in Torbutton. Both of these should improve with the TBB 3.0 release. But that is a separate thread.”</p>

<h1>Tor Hack Day, Munich, Germany</h1>

<p>Meet the people who spend their day making Tor a reality. Join them for a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/join-us-tor-hack-day-munich-germany">public hack day</a> on Friday, July 26, 2013 in Munich, Germany at the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">Technische Universität München</a>.</p>

<p>The agenda and conversations will be determined by you and Tor‘s team of developers and researchers — so bring your ideas, questions, projects, and technical expertise with you!</p>

<h1>13<sup>th</sup> Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium</h1>

<p>Many academic researchers and students interested in anonymity are already working with Tor. They also are part of a broader community of academics that gather every year during the <a href="http://petsymposium.org/">Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium</a>. <a href="http://petsymposium.org/2013/program.php">The 13<sup>th</sup> edition</a> was held in Bloomington, Indiana, USA and was again well attended.</p>

<p>Several Tor developers were among the crowd of around 130 attendees (this makes it a new record or very close). On the first day, the first workshop on <a href="http://petools.soic.indiana.edu/">Privacy Enhancing Tools (PETools)</a> was held, in which Roger Dingledine was invited to talk about “Lessons from Tor: How to Help Developers and Researchers Improve your Privacy Tool.”</p>

<p>During the next two days, researchers presented the selected papers. Two of them are directly relevant to the development of the Tor network:</p>

<p>Mashael Alsabah, Kevin Bauer, Tariq Elahi, and Ian Goldberg presented <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_65.pdf">Conflux</a>, “a dynamic traffic-splitting approach that assigns traffic to an overlay path based on its measured latency. […] Conflux considerably increases performance for clients using low-bandwidth bridges.” <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028950.html">A thread on tor-talk</a> discusses effects of Conflux on website fingerprinting.</p>

<p>John Geddes, Rob Jansen, and Nicholas Hopper studied <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_80.pdf">balancing performance with anonymity in Tor</a>. They have “investigated the effects of proposed [performance enhancing] modifications on attacks that rely on network measurements as a side channel.” The paper concluded with “an analysis of the total reduction in anonymity that clients face due to
each proposed mechanism.”</p>

<p>Other papers are relevant to the wider set of Tor problems:</p>

<p>David Fifield, Gabi Nakibly, and Dan Boneh have looked at <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_29.pdf">web-based online scanning service […] that can be covertly used as proxies in a censorship circumvention system</a> The system they describe is already “available as an experimental rendezvous for the <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/">flash proxy system</a> and is part of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html#download">Tor’s pluggable-transports web browser bundles</a> starting with the 2.4.11-alpha-1 release.”</p>

<p>Amir Houmansadr and Nikita Borisov presented an analysis of how practical it is to <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_71.pdf">reliably fingerprint millions of network flows by tagging only as few as tens of packets from each flow</a>.</p>

<p>An extra day was dedicated to the HotPETs workshop, intended to “foster new ideas, spirited debates, and controversial perspectives on privacy (and lack thereof).” Among other interesting submissions, Wenxuan Zhou, Amir Houmansadr, Matthew Caesar, and Nikita Borisov presented <a href="http://petsymposium.org/2013/papers/zhou-censorship.pdf">SWEET</a>, a way to encapsulate “a censored user’s traffic inside email messages that are carried over by typical email service providers.”</p>

<p>All papers presented during the conference are available for download from the program page.</p>

<p>The next edition of PETS will be help July 16-18, 2014, in Amsterdam.</p>

<h1>Hardware for high bandwidth relay</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002239.html">Andreas Fink asked for hints on hardware</a> that could support “big fat tor exit nodes connected with multiple 1gbps or 10gps links.”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002241.html">Andy Isaacson answered</a> that <a href="http://noisetor.net/">Noisetor</a> uses “most of a 4-core X3350 2.6 GHz to push ~500 Mbps symmetric. That‘s without AES-NI.” Mike Perry and Moritz Bartl then both confirmed that modern Intel Xeon CPUs with AES-NI could do 300 Mbit/s per core.</p>

<h1>Blocking GFW probes on the firewall</h1>

<p>Marek Majkowski suggests how to resist <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/pdf/foci2012.pdf">Chinese effort to scan Tor relays and bridges</a> using a firewall. Somewhere in the past month the Great Firewall of China started to actively probe the destination of any traffic that looked like a Tor bridge, plain or obfs2. If a handshake is successful, the connection is reset and the bridge address put on a blacklist.</p>

<p>As the probe sequence is static, Marek identified the incoming connection and gave <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028897.html">rules for the netfilter Linux firewall to filter them out</a>.</p>

<p>If you run a bridge under Linux, please give them a try!</p>

<h1>Is it worth running a relay on a home broadband connection?</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002240.html">Nick asked on the tor-relays mailing-list</a>: “I have a reasonable ADSL connection, and a little always-on server. The bandwidth is in the region of 2Mib/s down, something less up (maybe 256Kib/s). Is it useful for me to run a tor relay with this bandwidth?”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002249.html">Lunar pointed out</a> that a relay with this capacity was “likely to be selected as a middle node 1 time out of 10000 circuits, if not less…”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002255.html">Roger Dingledine drew the cut</a>: “at this point if you‘re at least 800kbit (100KBytes/s) each way, it‘s useful to be a relay.” He also detailed the current thresholds for the Stable and Guard flags.</p>

<p>Roger mentioned connections can still be of use though: ”a bridge is a fine thing to run on a connection with 250KBytes down and 32KBytes up.” And maybe even more in the future as “we might end up with a system like <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_65.pdf">Conflux</a> to let you glue together two slow bridges and get better throughput.”</p>

<h1>Using Mumble with Tor</h1>

<p>David H. wrote a <a href="http://huertanix.tumblr.com/post/55261352264/location-anonymous-voice-communication-a-step-by-step">tutorial on how to configure Mumble to use the Tor network on Ubuntu</a>. This tutorial includes setting up a server using Amazon EC2. During the discussion, adrelanos came up with his own <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Voip">tutorial on anonymous VoIP which focuses on installing Mumble on Whonix</a> behind an hidden service.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028939.html">follow the discussion on tor-talk</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>OONI has published a <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/zambia-a-country-under-deep-packet-inspection.html">detailed report</a> on how Zambia is currently censoring the grass roots online newspaper <a href="https://zambianwatchdog.com/">Zambian Watchdog</a>.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson merged a way to mock C functions in tor unit tests. The “mocking methodology” has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8949#comment:1">described</a> as “the simplest thing that could work — it‘s one of the ones that festoon the code with macro salad, and uglifies the declarations of functions that are going to get mocked. It has the advantage of being portable, robust, and comprehensible.”</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005129.html">Runa A. Sandvik announced</a> that she has disabled translations for Vidalia on Transifex as “translators should not work on resources which are currently not being maintained by a developer.”</p>

<p>Three GSoC students have sent updates: Johannes Fürmann on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005140.html">EvilGenius censorship simulation project</a>, Robert on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005141.html">Tor path generation and Stream-RTT probing</a>, and Hareesan on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005143.html">steganography browser addon</a>.</p>

          <p>Tor is looking for a Lead QA/automation engineer!</p>

<p>We want to deploy nightly builds and continuous integration for as many of our key software components and platform combinations as possible. Your job would be build and deploy the initial functional versions of a wide range of testing frameworks and continuous integration systems.</p>

<p>This is a contract position. Candidates are expected to be capable of taking the lead in selecting, deploying, and maintaining multiple automation systems in several different programming languages.</p>

<p>Candidates should also be capable of reproducing bugs and writing new reproduction test cases for one or more of the testing frameworks. Eventually, we hope to add additional staff to assist in this project, but to start, you will be expected to prioritize your own work such that the most important tasks get attention first, without letting any specific core component starve for attention.</p>

<p>For more details, including information on how to apply, see the job posting:
