<h1>Summer Development Meeting 2013</h1>

<p>About 40 core Tor contributors gathered over July 22-23 at the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">Technische Universität München</a> in Germany for <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting">this year&#39;s Summer Development Meeting</a>. That&#39;s quite a number, and as could be expected, there are a huge number of topics up for discussion — the brainstorming session generated around 150. Gunner from <a href="http://aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration Tech</a> is once again facilitating the meeting, helping everyone focus on the most pressing issues.</p>

<p>Rough notes from some of the break-out sessions are now up on the wiki. A list of the topics and a brief summary of the discussions are given below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/LoveForVolunteers">Love for volunteers</a>: strategies for outreach and long-term support; identifying where they&#39;re most needed</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/PluggableTransports0">Censorship and pluggable transports</a>: documenting the now-large number of pluggable transports; discussing countries&#39; differing censorship strategies</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/Fundraising">Fundraising</a>: funding outlook seems to be positive, although diversity in funding sources is needed to reduce dependency on single institutions like the US Government</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/WebsiteTranslation">Website Translation</a>: notes from a discussion which led to the definition of a new translation review process and a list of actionables</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/ServiceInfrastructure">Service infrastructure</a>: multiple fundamental services could use some more love: GetTor (TBB by email), website, Trac, check.tp.org, BridgeDB; shutting down unmaintained services</li>
<li><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/OpSec">Operational security</a>: random notes on OpSec for Tor people</li>
</ul>

<p>On the sidelines of the dev meeting, Roger and Jake are doing a public talk on the topic of <a href="https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum">Tor and the Censorship Arms Race</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to meet people who spend their day making Tor a reality, you can <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/join-us-tor-hack-day-munich-germany">join them for a public hack day</a> on Friday, July 26, 2013. Bring your ideas, questions, projects, and technical expertise with you!</p>

<h1>Remote descriptor fetching in Stem</h1>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005156.html">Damian Johnson announced</a> having implemented remote descriptor fetching in <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">Stem</a>, a feature to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-May/004924.html">migrate more metrics measurement tools to Python</a>. “Its usage is pleasantly simple” wrote Damian. See for yourself in the <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/api/descriptor/remote.html">excellent documentation</a>!</p>

<h1>Orbot 12.0.1 call for beta testing</h1>

<p>After a long interval, Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029063.html">announced the release of a new version of Orbot</a> — a client for the Tor network on Android mobile devices. For Orbot 12.0.1, the developers have “switched versioning styles to a simpler major.minor.bugfix model”, wrote Nathan.</p>

<p>He continues with a call for testing: “Since we haven&#39;t done a release in a while, and we have some new build tools, I mostly want to make sure I have not done something terribly wrong in the build process. Please confirm back if you are able to successfully use this release.”</p>

<p>Updates in 12.0.1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated to Tor 0.2.4.15-RC</li>
<li>flashy screen bug fixed now shows traffic</li>
<li>Stats in notification area</li>
<li>better handling of preference settings</li>
<li>Changes added superuser permission for Cyanogen</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk">download and start testing this release</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>

<p>Lunar reported on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000292.html">trip to Brussels for LSM 2013</a>. To sum it up, “people are really supportive of what we do these days”.</p>

<p>anonym outlined the <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003292.html">release schedule for Tails 0.20</a>.</p>

<p>intrigeri announced that <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003297.html">Tails has switched to a more conventional task manager</a>. It might now be easier for you to see what needs to be done. Have a look at the current list of 496 <a href="https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues">open issues</a>, there might be something waiting just for you.</p>

<p>Tor developers would love to find an easier way to debug tor when the daemon crashes. Nick Mathewson came up with an initial piece of code that could (when complete) <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9299">dump stack traces</a> on assertion, crash, or general trouble to the logs. There&#39;s more work to be done before it can be merged in Tor. Feel free to help — especially if you know how to do this on Windows or BSD.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson along with Andrea created a wiki page for <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/025/TicketTriage025">initial 0.2.5 series ticket triage</a>. If you have your own agenda for 0.2.5, you should be talking to them now!</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005158.html">Kostas Jakeliunas reported on their GSoC project</a> about producing a searchable metrics archive.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000291.html">Arturo reported</a> on his activities on Ooni probe in June.</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005161.html">Pierre Lalet announced</a> that he started working on an implementation of the Tor protocol in Python. The intent is to have an independent implementation to test Tor. As the author puts it, &quot;the purpose is NOT to implement a secure or robust implementation that could be an alternative to Tor.&quot; Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/cea-sec/TorPylle">the code</a>: &quot;Comments, fixes and questions welcome!&quot;</p>
