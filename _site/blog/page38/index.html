          <p>When we first launched the Tor help desk back in November 2011, we provided support in English and Farsi. We recently expanded the help desk with four more languages: Arabic, French, Mandarin, and Spanish. The help desk is a best effort service with no guarantees, but we generally respond within 48 hours.</p>

<p>For support in English, email <a href="mailto:help@rt.torproject.org">help@rt.torproject.org</a>. For other languages, try:</p>

          <p>Interested in coding on Tor and getting paid for it by Google? If you are a student, we have good news for you: We have been <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/tor">accepted as a mentoring organisation</a> for <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code 2013</a>!</p>

<p>Here are the facts: The summer of code gives you the opportunity to work on your own Tor-related coding project with one of the Tor developers as your mentor. You can apply for a coding project related to Tor itself or to one of its many <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Projects">supplemental projects</a>. Your mentor will help you when you&#39;re stuck with your project and guide you in becoming part of the Tor community. Google pays you 5,000 USD for the three months of your project, so that you can focus on coding and don&#39;t have to worry about how to pay your bills.</p>

<p>Did we catch your attention? These are your next steps: Go look at the <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page">Google Summer of Code FAQ</a> to make sure you are eligible to participate. Have a look at our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/gsoc.html.en#Ideas">ideas list</a> to see if one of those projects matches your interests. If there is no project on that list that you&#39;d want to work on, read the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en#UpToSpeed">documentation on our website</a> and make up your own project idea! Come to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/contact.html.en#irc">#tor-dev on OFTC</a> and let us know about your project idea. Communication is essential to success in the summer of code, and we&#39;re unlikely to accept students we haven&#39;t heard from before reading their application. So really, come to the IRC channel and talk to us!</p>

<p>Finally, write down your project idea using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/gsoc.html.en#Template">our template</a> and submit your application to Google <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#8._When_can_I_apply_for_Google_Summer_of">until May 3, 2013</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to discussing your project idea with you!</p>

          <p>Hi all. After eighteen months of work and a number of delays rivaling that of the Big Dig I&#39;m pleased to announce the initial release of stem!</p>

<p>For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, stem is a python controller library for tor. With it you can write scripts and applications that interact with your tor client or relay. For some examples of what you can do see the tutorials on...</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://stem.torproject.org/">https://stem.torproject.org/</a></strong></p>

<p>Stem is compatible with python 2.6 and higher (including the 3.x series), and is a near complete implementation of tor&#39;s control and directory specifications. It has relatively high test coverage (~80% for most modules) and integration tests to check its continued interoperability with new releases of tor.</p>

<p>As always, if you encounter issues or have feature requests then please <a href="http://www.atagar.com/contact/">let me know</a>! Also, if you write something that uses stem then please tell me, both so we can continue to improve our API and expand the tutorial&#39;s list of examples.</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone that helped make this initial release of stem possible, both with its development and packaging! -Damian</p>

          <p>On Monday the 25th of March, the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London organized a free event where journalists could <a href="http://www.tcij.org/events/2013-03-25/introduction-digital-security">learn more about digital security</a>. I was invited to speak about Tor, other speakers covered OTR, TrueCrypt, GPG, and mobile security.</p>

<p>The attendees were divided into five groups, and each speaker had 20-25 minutes with each group. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy">Pluggable Transports Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2012-TorProject-Annual-Report.pdf">2012 annual report</a>.</p>

<p>I talked a bit about the history of Tor and the Tor Project, discussed a few different threats, mentioned hidden services, listed a few examples of real world use, and helped everyone get the Tor Browser Bundle up and running. I did not have access to a projector or whiteboard, so I did my best to illustrate how Tor works by drawing boxes, arrows, blobs, and stick figures on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>A number of people asked if we had some sort of document or manual explaining all the topics covered at this event. I mentioned <a href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a box</a> and the <a href="http://flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>, but also pointed out that there is currently no single document available, that I am aware of, which explains all of these topics.</p>

<p>I have previously discussed creating such a document with the <a href="http://www.rorypecktrust.org/">Rory Peck Trust</a>, which is a London based organization that specializes in safety, security and professional development for freelance journalists. I mentioned this again when I met with them the day after the CIJ event, and I’m looking forward to seeing the end result in a few months.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tcij.org/">Centre for Investigative Journalism</a> for hosting the event and inviting me.</p>
