<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.22-alpha - 2011-01-25<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bounds-checking error that could allow an attacker to<br>
remotely crash a directory authority. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.<br>
Found by &quot;piebeer&quot;.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t assert when changing from bridge to relay or vice versa<br>
via the controller. The assert happened because we didn&#39;t properly<br>
initialize our keys in this case. Bugfix on 0.2.2.18-alpha; fixes<br>
bug 2433. Reported by bastik.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Adjust our TLS Diffie-Hellman parameters to match those used by<br>
Apache&#39;s mod_ssl.</li>
<li>Provide a log message stating which geoip file we&#39;re parsing<br>
instead of just stating that we&#39;re parsing the geoip file.<br>
Implements ticket 2432.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Check for and reject overly long directory certificates and<br>
directory tokens before they have a chance to hit any assertions.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.1.28 / 0.2.2.20-alpha. Found by &quot;doorss&quot;.</li>

        <p><p>We&#39;re holding a Tor hackfest on Saturday, February 19th. The bulk of the Tor developers are in town and coming to this event. Unlike last time when snow kept 75% of them outside the US.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be meeting starting at 10 AM in the new Media Lab building (E14), thanks to the Center for Future Civic Media at MIT. We&#39;re hoping to provide pizza and drinks for lunch. Last time we had some fine Indian food for dinner.</p>

<p>Please attend if you have some interest in programming, advocacy, marketing, or research with Tor, or are willing to be persuaded to entertain an interest. :) Tor&#39;s a small project (in terms of number of developers) that could really use your help.<br>
Hope to see you on Saturday!</p>

        <p><p>Here&#39;s a quick update on what we&#39;re seeing from Tor clients in Iran. This is an update to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran</a>. It appears that one of the five Iranian ISPs is experimenting in blocking censorship circumvention tools; such as Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, and Hot Spot Shield. There have been reports that this update to censorship technologies was coming soon, <a href="https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560" title="https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560">https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, we had data suggesting that ssl-connections were being throttled or experiencing a forced reduced-throughput. It seems this is no longer the case. A simple IP address access list is used to stop access to the public Tor nodes, as well as many Tor bridges. An example of this blocklist on the Iranian Tor users:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/direct-users-2011-01-21-ir-2010-10-23.png" alt=""></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-users-2011-01-21-ir-2010-10-23.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We are seeing success in users choosing to configure their Tor clients to use a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/proxychain">socks or https proxy</a> and then connecting to the public Tor network. The trick here is that Iranian tor users now look to be coming from wherever the open proxy is located. A few volunteers in Europe and SE Asia have setup <a href="http://www.inet.no/dante/">proxy servers</a> restricted to Iranian IP space.</p>

<p>On a more technical level, here&#39;s what we were seeing last week for ssl manipulation, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt" title="https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt">https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt</a>. What&#39;s interesting is the tor-server to client communication is with a TTL of 40. The TLSv1 Encrypted Alert is from the tor-server, except the TTL is 39. Unless the tor-server suddenly jumped one hop further from the client, something intercepted the connection and injected that packet on behalf of the tor-server.</p>

<p>This week we&#39;re seeing straight IP blocking after the ssl handshake starts, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt" title="https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt">https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt</a>. In both cases, this is to the same tor bridge from the same tor client as before.</p>

<p>In a short few months, Iran has vastly improved the sophistication of their censorship technologies. Right now, the best option is to use tor through open socks/https proxies. A risk is the open proxies can see you are using tor, but cannot see the traffic passing through the open proxy, for everything is wrapped in layers of encryption by Tor. However, it appears the Iranian Potato Wall can detect Tor or not in any case by analyzing the traffic on the wire. We have reports this is true for other circumvention tools as well.</p>

<p>I thank the many people that have taken risks to share data with us.</p>

        <p><p>Note to <strong>64-bit Linux Tor Browser Bundle</strong> users: The previous bundles contained Tor 0.2.2.20-alpha. Please upgrade to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/linux/tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-1.1.3-dev-en-US.tar.gz">1.1.3-1</a> ( <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/linux/tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-1.1.3-dev-en-US.tar.gz.asc">sig</a>).</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.21-alpha includes all the patches from Tor 0.2.1.29, which<br>
continues our recent code security audit work. The main fix resolves<br>
a remote heap overflow vulnerability that can allow remote code<br>
execution (CVE-2011-0427). Other fixes address a variety of assert<br>
and crash bugs, most of which we think are hard to exploit remotely.</p>

<p><strong>All Tor users should upgrade.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.21-alpha - 2011-01-15<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes (security), also included in 0.2.1.29:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a heap overflow bug where an adversary could cause heap<br>
corruption. This bug probably allows remote code execution<br>
attacks. Reported by &quot;debuger&quot;. Fixes CVE-2011-0427. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.10-rc.</li>
<li>Prevent a denial-of-service attack by disallowing any<br>
zlib-compressed data whose compression factor is implausibly<br>
high. Fixes part of bug 2324; reported by &quot;doorss&quot;.</li>
<li>Zero out a few more keys in memory before freeing them. Fixes<br>
bug 2384 and part of bug 2385. These key instances found by<br>
&quot;cypherpunks&quot;, based on Andrew Case&#39;s report about being able<br>
to find sensitive data in Tor&#39;s memory space if you have enough<br>
permissions. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre9.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes (crashes), also included in 0.2.1.29:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent calls to Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.<br>
This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially<br>
if running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running<br>
Tor with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.<br>
Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc. Fixes bug 2190.</li>
<li>Add a check for SIZE_T_MAX to tor_realloc() to try to avoid<br>
underflow errors there too. Fixes the other part of bug 2324.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where we would assert if we ever had a<br>
cached-descriptors.new file (or another file read directly into<br>
memory) of exactly SIZE_T_CEILING bytes. Fixes bug 2326; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.1.25. Found by doorss.</li>
<li>Fix some potential asserts and parsing issues with grossly<br>
malformed router caches. Fixes bug 2352; bugfix on Tor 0.2.1.27.<br>
Found by doorss.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (other), also included in 0.2.1.29:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bug with handling misformed replies to reverse DNS lookup<br>
requests in DNSPort. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Related to a<br>
bug reported by doorss.</li>
<li>Fix compilation on mingw when a pthreads compatibility library<br>
has been installed. (We don&#39;t want to use it, so we shouldn&#39;t<br>
be including pthread.h.) Fixes bug 2313; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where we would declare that we had run out of virtual<br>
addresses when the address space was only half-exhausted. Bugfix<br>
on 0.1.2.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Correctly handle the case where AutomapHostsOnResolve is set but<br>
no virtual addresses are available. Fixes bug 2328; bugfix on<br>
0.1.2.1-alpha. Bug found by doorss.</li>
<li>Correctly handle wrapping around when we run out of virtual<br>
address space. Found by cypherpunks; bugfix on 0.2.0.5-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features, also included in 0.2.1.29:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Update to the January 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
<li>Introduce output size checks on all of our decryption functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Build changes, also included in 0.2.1.29:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tor does not build packages correctly with Automake 1.6 and earlier;<br>
added a check to Makefile.am to make sure that we&#39;re building with<br>
Automake 1.7 or later.</li>
<li>The 0.2.1.28 tarball was missing src/common/OpenBSD_malloc_Linux.c<br>
because we built it with a too-old version of automake. Thus that<br>
release broke ./configure --enable-openbsd-malloc, which is popular<br>
among really fast exit relays on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes, new in 0.2.2.21-alpha:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent crash/heap corruption when the cbtnummodes consensus<br>
parameter is set to 0 or large values. Fixes bug 2317; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.2.14-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features, new in 0.2.2.21-alpha:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce minimum/maximum values that clients will believe<br>
from the consensus. Now we&#39;ll have a better chance to avoid crashes<br>
or worse when a consensus param has a weird value.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features, new in 0.2.2.21-alpha:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to disable DirPort if running as a bridge. DirPorts aren&#39;t<br>
used on bridges, and it makes bridge scanning somewhat easier.</li>
<li>If writing the state file to disk fails, wait up to an hour before<br>
retrying again, rather than trying again each second. Fixes bug<br>
2346; bugfix on Tor 0.1.1.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Make Libevent log messages get delivered to controllers later,<br>
and not from inside the Libevent log handler. This prevents unsafe<br>
reentrant Libevent calls while still letting the log messages<br>
get through.</li>
<li>Detect platforms that brokenly use a signed size_t, and refuse to<br>
build there. Found and analyzed by doorss and rransom.</li>
<li>Fix a bunch of compile warnings revealed by mingw with gcc 4.5.<br>
Resolves bug 2314.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes, new in 0.2.2.21-alpha:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Handle SOCKS messages longer than 128 bytes long correctly, rather<br>
than waiting forever for them to finish. Fixes bug 2330; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Found by doorss.</li>
<li>Add assertions to check for overflow in arguments to<br>
base32_encode() and base32_decode(); fix a signed-unsigned<br>
comparison there too. These bugs are not actually reachable in Tor,<br>
but it&#39;s good to prevent future errors too. Found by doorss.</li>
<li>Correctly detect failures to create DNS requests when using Libevent<br>
versions before v2. (Before Libevent 2, we used our own evdns<br>
implementation. Its return values for Libevent&#39;s evdns_resolve_*()<br>
functions are not consistent with those from Libevent.) Fixes bug<br>
2363; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha. Found by &quot;lodger&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation, new in 0.2.2.21-alpha:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Document the default socks host and port (127.0.0.1:9050) for<br>
tor-resolve.</li>
</ul>
