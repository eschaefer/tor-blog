<p>Tor 0.2.0.30 is released. A better formatted version of this report can be found <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.onion-routing.announce/21">at gmane.org</a></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.30 switches to a more efficient directory distribution design,<br>
adds features to make connections to the Tor network harder to block,<br>
allows Tor to act as a DNS proxy, adds separate rate limiting for relayed<br>
traffic to make it easier for clients to become relays, fixes a variety<br>
of potential anonymity problems, and includes the usual huge pile of<br>
other features and bug fixes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html">https://www.torproject.org/download.html</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.30 - 2008-07-15<br>
 o New v3 directory design:<br>
 - Tor now uses a new way to learn about and distribute information<br>
 about the network: the directory authorities vote on a common<br>
 network status document rather than each publishing their own<br>
 opinion. Now clients and caches download only one networkstatus<br>
 document to bootstrap, rather than downloading one for each<br>
 authority. Clients only download router descriptors listed in<br>
 the consensus. Implements proposal 101; see doc/spec/dir-spec.txt<br>
 for details.<br>
 - Set up moria1, tor26, and dizum as v3 directory authorities<br>
 in addition to being v2 authorities. Also add three new ones:<br>
 ides (run by Mike Perry), gabelmoo (run by Karsten Loesing), and<br>
 dannenberg (run by CCC).<br>
 - Switch to multi-level keys for directory authorities: now their<br>
 long-term identity key can be kept offline, and they periodically<br>
 generate a new signing key. Clients fetch the &quot;key certificates&quot;<br>
 to keep up to date on the right keys. Add a standalone tool<br>
 &quot;tor-gencert&quot; to generate key certificates. Implements proposal 103.<br>
 - Add a new V3AuthUseLegacyKey config option to make it easier for<br>
 v3 authorities to change their identity keys if another bug like<br>
 Debian&#39;s OpenSSL RNG flaw appears.<br>
 - Authorities and caches fetch the v2 networkstatus documents<br>
 less often, now that v3 is recommended.</p>

<p>o Make Tor connections stand out less on the wire:<br>
 - Use an improved TLS handshake designed by Steven Murdoch in proposal<br>
 124, as revised in proposal 130. The new handshake is meant to<br>
 be harder for censors to fingerprint, and it adds the ability<br>
 to detect certain kinds of man-in-the-middle traffic analysis<br>
 attacks. The new handshake format includes version negotiation for<br>
 OR connections as described in proposal 105, which will allow us<br>
 to improve Tor&#39;s link protocol more safely in the future.<br>
 - Enable encrypted directory connections by default for non-relays,<br>
 so censor tools that block Tor directory connections based on their<br>
 plaintext patterns will no longer work. This means Tor works in<br>
 certain censored countries by default again.<br>
 - Stop including recognizeable strings in the commonname part of<br>
 Tor&#39;s x509 certificates.</p>

<p>o Implement bridge relays:<br>
 - Bridge relays (or &quot;bridges&quot; for short) are Tor relays that aren&#39;t<br>
 listed in the main Tor directory. Since there is no complete public<br>
 list of them, even an ISP that is filtering connections to all the<br>
 known Tor relays probably won&#39;t be able to block all the bridges.<br>
 See doc/design-paper/blocking.pdf and proposal 125 for details.<br>
 - New config option BridgeRelay that specifies you want to be a<br>
 bridge relay rather than a normal relay. When BridgeRelay is set<br>
 to 1, then a) you cache dir info even if your DirPort ins&#39;t on,<br>
 and b) the default for PublishServerDescriptor is now &quot;bridge&quot;<br>
 rather than &quot;v2,v3&quot;.<br>
 - New config option &quot;UseBridges 1&quot; for clients that want to use bridge<br>
 relays instead of ordinary entry guards. Clients then specify<br>
 bridge relays by adding &quot;Bridge&quot; lines to their config file. Users<br>
 can learn about a bridge relay either manually through word of<br>
 mouth, or by one of our rate-limited mechanisms for giving out<br>
 bridge addresses without letting an attacker easily enumerate them<br>
 all. See <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges" title="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">https://www.torproject.org/bridges</a> for details.<br>
 - Bridge relays behave like clients with respect to time intervals<br>
 for downloading new v3 consensus documents -- otherwise they<br>
 stand out. Bridge users now wait until the end of the interval,<br>
 so their bridge relay will be sure to have a new consensus document.</p>

<p>o Implement bridge directory authorities:<br>
 - Bridge authorities are like normal directory authorities, except<br>
 they don&#39;t serve a list of known bridges. Therefore users that know<br>
 a bridge&#39;s fingerprint can fetch a relay descriptor for that bridge,<br>
 including fetching updates e.g. if the bridge changes IP address,<br>
 yet an attacker can&#39;t just fetch a list of all the bridges.<br>
 - Set up Tonga as the default bridge directory authority.<br>
 - Bridge authorities refuse to serve bridge descriptors or other<br>
 bridge information over unencrypted connections (that is, when<br>
 responding to direct DirPort requests rather than begin_dir cells.)<br>
 - Bridge directory authorities do reachability testing on the<br>
 bridges they know. They provide router status summaries to the<br>
 controller via &quot;getinfo ns/purpose/bridge&quot;, and also dump summaries<br>
 to a file periodically, so we can keep internal stats about which<br>
 bridges are functioning.<br>
 - If bridge users set the UpdateBridgesFromAuthority config option,<br>
 but the digest they ask for is a 404 on the bridge authority,<br>
 they fall back to contacting the bridge directly.<br>
 - Bridges always use begin_dir to publish their server descriptor to<br>
 the bridge authority using an anonymous encrypted tunnel.<br>
 - Early work on a &quot;bridge community&quot; design: if bridge authorities set<br>
 the BridgePassword config option, they will serve a snapshot of<br>
 known bridge routerstatuses from their DirPort to anybody who<br>
 knows that password. Unset by default.<br>
 - Tor now includes an IP-to-country GeoIP file, so bridge relays can<br>
 report sanitized aggregated summaries in their extra-info documents<br>
 privately to the bridge authority, listing which countries are<br>
 able to reach them. We hope this mechanism will let us learn when<br>
 certain countries start trying to block bridges.<br>
 - Bridge authorities write bridge descriptors to disk, so they can<br>
 reload them after a reboot. They can also export the descriptors<br>
 to other programs, so we can distribute them to blocked users via<br>
 the BridgeDB interface, e.g. via <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/" title="https://bridges.torproject.org/">https://bridges.torproject.org/</a><br>
 and bridges torproject.org.</p>

<p>o Tor can be a DNS proxy:<br>
 - The new client-side DNS proxy feature replaces the need for<br>
 dns-proxy-tor: Just set &quot;DNSPort 9999&quot;, and Tor will now listen<br>
 for DNS requests on port 9999, use the Tor network to resolve them<br>
 anonymously, and send the reply back like a regular DNS server.<br>
 The code still only implements a subset of DNS.<br>
 - Add a new AutomapHostsOnResolve option: when it is enabled, any<br>
 resolve request for hosts matching a given pattern causes Tor to<br>
 generate an internal virtual address mapping for that host. This<br>
 allows DNSPort to work sensibly with hidden service users. By<br>
 default, .exit and .onion addresses are remapped; the list of<br>
 patterns can be reconfigured with AutomapHostsSuffixes.<br>
 - Add an &quot;-F&quot; option to tor-resolve to force a resolve for a .onion<br>
 address. Thanks to the AutomapHostsOnResolve option, this is no<br>
 longer a completely silly thing to do.</p>

<p>o Major features (relay usability):<br>
 - New config options RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst:<br>
 a separate set of token buckets for relayed traffic. Right now<br>
 relayed traffic is defined as answers to directory requests, and<br>
 OR connections that don&#39;t have any local circuits on them. See<br>
 proposal 111 for details.<br>
 - Create listener connections before we setuid to the configured<br>
 User and Group. Now non-Windows users can choose port values<br>
 under 1024, start Tor as root, and have Tor bind those ports<br>
 before it changes to another UID. (Windows users could already<br>
 pick these ports.)<br>
 - Added a new ConstrainedSockets config option to set SO_SNDBUF and<br>
 SO_RCVBUF on TCP sockets. Hopefully useful for Tor servers running<br>
 on &quot;vserver&quot; accounts. Patch from coderman.</p>

<p>o Major features (directory authorities):<br>
 - Directory authorities track weighted fractional uptime and weighted<br>
 mean-time-between failures for relays. WFU is suitable for deciding<br>
 whether a node is &quot;usually up&quot;, while MTBF is suitable for deciding<br>
 whether a node is &quot;likely to stay up.&quot; We need both, because<br>
 &quot;usually up&quot; is a good requirement for guards, while &quot;likely to<br>
 stay up&quot; is a good requirement for long-lived connections.<br>
 - Directory authorities use a new formula for selecting which relays<br>
 to advertise as Guards: they must be in the top 7/8 in terms of<br>
 how long we have known about them, and above the median of those<br>
 nodes in terms of weighted fractional uptime.<br>
 - Directory authorities use a new formula for selecting which relays<br>
 to advertise as Stable: when we have 4 or more days of data, use<br>
 median measured MTBF rather than median declared uptime. Implements<br>
 proposal 108.<br>
 - Directory authorities accept and serve &quot;extra info&quot; documents for<br>
 routers. Routers now publish their bandwidth-history lines in the<br>
 extra-info docs rather than the main descriptor. This step saves<br>
 60% (!) on compressed router descriptor downloads. Servers upload<br>
 extra-info docs to any authority that accepts them; directory<br>
 authorities now allow multiple router descriptors and/or extra<br>
 info documents to be uploaded in a single go. Authorities, and<br>
 caches that have been configured to download extra-info documents,<br>
 download them as needed. Implements proposal 104.<br>
 - Authorities now list relays who have the same nickname as<br>
 a different named relay, but list them with a new flag:<br>
 &quot;Unnamed&quot;. Now we can make use of relays that happen to pick the<br>
 same nickname as a server that registered two years ago and then<br>
 disappeared. Implements proposal 122.<br>
 - Store routers in a file called cached-descriptors instead of in<br>
 cached-routers. Initialize cached-descriptors from cached-routers<br>
 if the old format is around. The new format allows us to store<br>
 annotations along with descriptors, to record the time we received<br>
 each descriptor, its source, and its purpose: currently one of<br>
 general, controller, or bridge.</p>

<p>o Major features (other):<br>
 - New config options WarnPlaintextPorts and RejectPlaintextPorts so<br>
 Tor can warn and/or refuse connections to ports commonly used with<br>
 vulnerable-plaintext protocols. Currently we warn on ports 23,<br>
 109, 110, and 143, but we don&#39;t reject any. Based on proposal 129<br>
 by Kevin Bauer and Damon McCoy.<br>
 - Integrate Karsten Loesing&#39;s Google Summer of Code project to publish<br>
 hidden service descriptors on a set of redundant relays that are a<br>
 function of the hidden service address. Now we don&#39;t have to rely<br>
 on three central hidden service authorities for publishing and<br>
 fetching every hidden service descriptor. Implements proposal 114.<br>
 - Allow tunnelled directory connections to ask for an encrypted<br>
 &quot;begin_dir&quot; connection or an anonymized &quot;uses a full Tor circuit&quot;<br>
 connection independently. Now we can make anonymized begin_dir<br>
 connections for (e.g.) more secure hidden service posting and<br>
 fetching.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (crashes and assert failures):<br>
 - Stop imposing an arbitrary maximum on the number of file descriptors<br>
 used for busy servers. Bug reported by Olaf Selke; patch from<br>
 Sebastian Hahn.<br>
 - Avoid possible failures when generating a directory with routers<br>
 with over-long versions strings, or too many flags set.<br>
 - Fix a rare assert error when we&#39;re closing one of our threads:<br>
 use a mutex to protect the list of logs, so we never write to the<br>
 list as it&#39;s being freed. Fixes the very rare bug 575, which is<br>
 kind of the revenge of bug 222.<br>
 - Avoid segfault in the case where a badly behaved v2 versioning<br>
 directory sends a signed networkstatus with missing client-versions.<br>
 - When we hit an EOF on a log (probably because we&#39;re shutting down),<br>
 don&#39;t try to remove the log from the list: just mark it as<br>
 unusable. (Bulletproofs against bug 222.)</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (code security fixes):<br>
 - Detect size overflow in zlib code. Reported by Justin Ferguson and<br>
 Dan Kaminsky.<br>
 - Rewrite directory tokenization code to never run off the end of<br>
 a string. Fixes bug 455. Patch from croup.<br>
 - Be more paranoid about overwriting sensitive memory on free(),<br>
 as a defensive programming tactic to ensure forward secrecy.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (anonymity fixes):<br>
 - Reject requests for reverse-dns lookup of names that are in<br>
 a private address space. Patch from lodger.<br>
 - Never report that we&#39;ve used more bandwidth than we&#39;re willing to<br>
 relay: it leaks how much non-relay traffic we&#39;re using. Resolves<br>
 bug 516.<br>
 - As a client, do not believe any server that tells us that an<br>
 address maps to an internal address space.<br>
 - Warn about unsafe ControlPort configurations.<br>
 - Directory authorities now call routers Fast if their bandwidth is<br>
 at least 100KB/s, and consider their bandwidth adequate to be a<br>
 Guard if it is at least 250KB/s, no matter the medians. This fix<br>
 complements proposal 107.<br>
 - Directory authorities now never mark more than 2 servers per IP as<br>
 Valid and Running (or 5 on addresses shared by authorities).<br>
 Implements proposal 109, by Kevin Bauer and Damon McCoy.<br>
 - If we&#39;re a relay, avoid picking ourselves as an introduction point,<br>
 a rendezvous point, or as the final hop for internal circuits. Bug<br>
 reported by taranis and lodger.<br>
 - Exit relays that are used as a client can now reach themselves<br>
 using the .exit notation, rather than just launching an infinite<br>
 pile of circuits. Fixes bug 641. Reported by Sebastian Hahn.<br>
 - Fix a bug where, when we were choosing the &#39;end stream reason&#39; to<br>
 put in our relay end cell that we send to the exit relay, Tor<br>
 clients on Windows were sometimes sending the wrong &#39;reason&#39;. The<br>
 anonymity problem is that exit relays may be able to guess whether<br>
 the client is running Windows, thus helping partition the anonymity<br>
 set. Down the road we should stop sending reasons to exit relays,<br>
 or otherwise prevent future versions of this bug.<br>
 - Only update guard status (usable / not usable) once we have<br>
 enough directory information. This was causing us to discard all our<br>
 guards on startup if we hadn&#39;t been running for a few weeks. Fixes<br>
 bug 448.<br>
 - When our directory information has been expired for a while, stop<br>
 being willing to build circuits using it. Fixes bug 401.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (peace of mind for relay operators)<br>
 - Non-exit relays no longer answer &quot;resolve&quot; relay cells, so they<br>
 can&#39;t be induced to do arbitrary DNS requests. (Tor clients already<br>
 avoid using non-exit relays for resolve cells, but now servers<br>
 enforce this too.) Fixes bug 619. Patch from lodger.<br>
 - When we setconf ClientOnly to 1, close any current OR and Dir<br>
 listeners. Reported by mwenge.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (other):<br>
 - If we only ever used Tor for hidden service lookups or posts, we<br>
 would stop building circuits and start refusing connections after<br>
 24 hours, since we falsely believed that Tor was dormant. Reported<br>
 by nwf.<br>
 - Add a new __HashedControlSessionPassword option for controllers<br>
 to use for one-off session password hashes that shouldn&#39;t get<br>
 saved to disk by SAVECONF --- Vidalia users were accumulating a<br>
 pile of HashedControlPassword lines in their torrc files, one for<br>
 each time they had restarted Tor and then clicked Save. Make Tor<br>
 automatically convert &quot;HashedControlPassword&quot; to this new option but<br>
 only when it&#39;s given on the command line. Partial fix for bug 586.<br>
 - Patch from &quot;Andrew S. Lists&quot; to catch when we contact a directory<br>
 mirror at IP address X and he says we look like we&#39;re coming from<br>
 IP address X. Otherwise this would screw up our address detection.<br>
 - Reject uploaded descriptors and extrainfo documents if they&#39;re<br>
 huge. Otherwise we&#39;ll cache them all over the network and it&#39;ll<br>
 clog everything up. Suggested by Aljosha Judmayer.<br>
 - When a hidden service was trying to establish an introduction point,<br>
 and Tor *did* manage to reuse one of the preemptively built<br>
 circuits, it didn&#39;t correctly remember which one it used,<br>
 so it asked for another one soon after, until there were no<br>
 more preemptive circuits, at which point it launched one from<br>
 scratch. Bugfix on 0.0.9.x.</p>

<p>o Rate limiting and load balancing improvements:<br>
 - When we add data to a write buffer in response to the data on that<br>
 write buffer getting low because of a flush, do not consider the<br>
 newly added data as a candidate for immediate flushing, but rather<br>
 make it wait until the next round of writing. Otherwise, we flush<br>
 and refill recursively, and a single greedy TLS connection can<br>
 eat all of our bandwidth.<br>
 - When counting the number of bytes written on a TLS connection,<br>
 look at the BIO actually used for writing to the network, not<br>
 at the BIO used (sometimes) to buffer data for the network.<br>
 Looking at different BIOs could result in write counts on the<br>
 order of ULONG_MAX. Fixes bug 614.<br>
 - If we change our MaxAdvertisedBandwidth and then reload torrc,<br>
 Tor won&#39;t realize it should publish a new relay descriptor. Fixes<br>
 bug 688, reported by mfr.<br>
 - Avoid using too little bandwidth when our clock skips a few seconds.<br>
 - Choose which bridge to use proportional to its advertised bandwidth,<br>
 rather than uniformly at random. This should speed up Tor for<br>
 bridge users. Also do this for people who set StrictEntryNodes.</p>

<p>o Bootstrapping faster and building circuits more intelligently:<br>
 - Fix bug 660 that was preventing us from knowing that we should<br>
 preemptively build circuits to handle expected directory requests.<br>
 - When we&#39;re checking if we have enough dir info for each relay<br>
 to begin establishing circuits, make sure that we actually have<br>
 the descriptor listed in the consensus, not just any descriptor.<br>
 - Correctly notify one-hop connections when a circuit build has<br>
 failed. Possible fix for bug 669. Found by lodger.<br>
 - Clients now hold circuitless TLS connections open for 1.5 times<br>
 MaxCircuitDirtiness (15 minutes), since it is likely that they&#39;ll<br>
 rebuild a new circuit over them within that timeframe. Previously,<br>
 they held them open only for KeepalivePeriod (5 minutes).</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (memory):<br>
 - Add OpenBSD malloc code from &quot;phk&quot; as an optional malloc<br>
 replacement on Linux: some glibc libraries do very poorly with<br>
 Tor&#39;s memory allocation patterns. Pass --enable-openbsd-malloc to<br>
 ./configure to get the replacement malloc code.<br>
 - Switch our old ring buffer implementation for one more like that<br>
 used by free Unix kernels. The wasted space in a buffer with 1mb<br>
 of data will now be more like 8k than 1mb. The new implementation<br>
 also avoids realloc();realloc(); patterns that can contribute to<br>
 memory fragmentation.<br>
 - Change the way that Tor buffers data that it is waiting to write.<br>
 Instead of queueing data cells in an enormous ring buffer for each<br>
 client-&gt;OR or OR-&gt;OR connection, we now queue cells on a separate<br>
 queue for each circuit. This lets us use less slack memory, and<br>
 will eventually let us be smarter about prioritizing different kinds<br>
 of traffic.<br>
 - Reference-count and share copies of address policy entries; only 5%<br>
 of them were actually distinct.<br>
 - Tune parameters for cell pool allocation to minimize amount of<br>
 RAM overhead used.<br>
 - Keep unused 4k and 16k buffers on free lists, rather than wasting 8k<br>
 for every single inactive connection_t. Free items from the<br>
 4k/16k-buffer free lists when they haven&#39;t been used for a while.<br>
 - Make memory debugging information describe more about history<br>
 of cell allocation, so we can help reduce our memory use.<br>
 - Be even more aggressive about releasing RAM from small<br>
 empty buffers. Thanks to our free-list code, this shouldn&#39;t be too<br>
 performance-intensive.<br>
 - Log malloc statistics from mallinfo() on platforms where it exists.<br>
 - Use memory pools to allocate cells with better speed and memory<br>
 efficiency, especially on platforms where malloc() is inefficient.<br>
 - Add a --with-tcmalloc option to the configure script to link<br>
 against tcmalloc (if present). Does not yet search for non-system<br>
 include paths.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (socket management):<br>
 - Count the number of open sockets separately from the number of<br>
 active connection_t objects. This will let us avoid underusing<br>
 our allocated connection limit.<br>
 - We no longer use socket pairs to link an edge connection to an<br>
 anonymous directory connection or a DirPort test connection.<br>
 Instead, we track the link internally and transfer the data<br>
 in-process. This saves two sockets per &quot;linked&quot; connection (at the<br>
 client and at the server), and avoids the nasty Windows socketpair()<br>
 workaround.<br>
 - We were leaking a file descriptor if Tor started with a zero-length<br>
 cached-descriptors file. Patch by &quot;freddy77&quot;.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (CPU use):<br>
 - Never walk through the list of logs if we know that no log target<br>
 is interested in a given message.<br>
 - Call routerlist_remove_old_routers() much less often. This should<br>
 speed startup, especially on directory caches.<br>
 - Base64 decoding was actually showing up on our profile when parsing<br>
 the initial descriptor file; switch to an in-process all-at-once<br>
 implementation that&#39;s about 3.5x times faster than calling out to<br>
 OpenSSL.<br>
 - Use a slightly simpler string hashing algorithm (copying Python&#39;s<br>
 instead of Java&#39;s) and optimize our digest hashing algorithm to take<br>
 advantage of 64-bit platforms and to remove some possibly-costly<br>
 voodoo.<br>
 - When implementing AES counter mode, update only the portions of the<br>
 counter buffer that need to change, and don&#39;t keep separate<br>
 network-order and host-order counters on big-endian hosts (where<br>
 they are the same).<br>
 - Add an in-place version of aes_crypt() so that we can avoid doing a<br>
 needless memcpy() call on each cell payload.<br>
 - Use Critical Sections rather than Mutexes for synchronizing threads<br>
 on win32; Mutexes are heavier-weight, and designed for synchronizing<br>
 between processes.</p>

<p>o Performance improvements (bandwidth use):<br>
 - Don&#39;t try to launch new descriptor downloads quite so often when we<br>
 already have enough directory information to build circuits.<br>
 - Version 1 directories are no longer generated in full. Instead,<br>
 authorities generate and serve &quot;stub&quot; v1 directories that list<br>
 no servers. This will stop Tor versions 0.1.0.x and earlier from<br>
 working, but (for security reasons) nobody should be running those<br>
 versions anyway.<br>
 - Avoid going directly to the directory authorities even if you&#39;re a<br>
 relay, if you haven&#39;t found yourself reachable yet or if you&#39;ve<br>
 decided not to advertise your dirport yet. Addresses bug 556.<br>
 - If we&#39;ve gone 12 hours since our last bandwidth check, and we<br>
 estimate we have less than 50KB bandwidth capacity but we could<br>
 handle more, do another bandwidth test.<br>
 - Support &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; when answering HTTP requests for<br>
 directories, running-routers documents, and v2 and v3 networkstatus<br>
 documents. (There&#39;s no need to support it for router descriptors,<br>
 since those are downloaded by descriptor digest.)<br>
 - Stop fetching directory info so aggressively if your DirPort is<br>
 on but your ORPort is off; stop fetching v2 dir info entirely.<br>
 You can override these choices with the new FetchDirInfoEarly<br>
 config option.</p>

<p>o Changed config option behavior (features):<br>
 - Configuration files now accept C-style strings as values. This<br>
 helps encode characters not allowed in the current configuration<br>
 file format, such as newline or #. Addresses bug 557.<br>
 - Add hidden services and DNSPorts to the list of things that make<br>
 Tor accept that it has running ports. Change starting Tor with no<br>
 ports from a fatal error to a warning; we might change it back if<br>
 this turns out to confuse anybody. Fixes bug 579.<br>
 - Make PublishServerDescriptor default to 1, so the default doesn&#39;t<br>
 have to change as we invent new directory protocol versions.<br>
 - Allow people to say PreferTunnelledDirConns rather than<br>
 PreferTunneledDirConns, for those alternate-spellers out there.<br>
 - Raise the default BandwidthRate/BandwidthBurst to 5MB/10MB, to<br>
 accommodate the growing number of servers that use the default<br>
 and are reaching it.<br>
 - Make it possible to enable HashedControlPassword and<br>
 CookieAuthentication at the same time.<br>
 - When a TrackHostExits-chosen exit fails too many times in a row,<br>
 stop using it. Fixes bug 437.</p>

<p>o Changed config option behavior (bugfixes):<br>
 - Do not read the configuration file when we&#39;ve only been told to<br>
 generate a password hash. Fixes bug 643. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5. Fix<br>
 based on patch from Sebastian Hahn.<br>
 - Actually validate the options passed to AuthDirReject,<br>
 AuthDirInvalid, AuthDirBadDir, and AuthDirBadExit.<br>
 - Make &quot;ClientOnly 1&quot; config option disable directory ports too.<br>
 - Don&#39;t stop fetching descriptors when FetchUselessDescriptors is<br>
 set, even if we stop asking for circuits. Bug reported by tup<br>
 and ioerror.<br>
 - Servers used to decline to publish their DirPort if their<br>
 BandwidthRate or MaxAdvertisedBandwidth were below a threshold. Now<br>
 they look only at BandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthRate.<br>
 - Treat &quot;2gb&quot; when given in torrc for a bandwidth as meaning 2gb,<br>
 minus 1 byte: the actual maximum declared bandwidth.<br>
 - Make &quot;TrackHostExits .&quot; actually work. Bugfix on 0.1.0.x.<br>
 - Make the NodeFamilies config option work. (Reported by<br>
 lodger -- it has never actually worked, even though we added it<br>
 in Oct 2004.)<br>
 - If Tor is invoked from something that isn&#39;t a shell (e.g. Vidalia),<br>
 now we expand &quot;-f ~/.tor/torrc&quot; correctly. Suggested by Matt Edman.</p>

<p>o New config options:<br>
 - New configuration options AuthDirMaxServersPerAddr and<br>
 AuthDirMaxServersperAuthAddr to override default maximum number<br>
 of servers allowed on a single IP address. This is important for<br>
 running a test network on a single host.<br>
 - Three new config options (AlternateDirAuthority,<br>
 AlternateBridgeAuthority, and AlternateHSAuthority) that let the<br>
 user selectively replace the default directory authorities by type,<br>
 rather than the all-or-nothing replacement that DirServer offers.<br>
 - New config options AuthDirBadDir and AuthDirListBadDirs for<br>
 authorities to mark certain relays as &quot;bad directories&quot; in the<br>
 networkstatus documents. Also supports the &quot;!baddir&quot; directive in<br>
 the approved-routers file.<br>
 - New config option V2AuthoritativeDirectory that all v2 directory<br>
 authorities must set. This lets v3 authorities choose not to serve<br>
 v2 directory information.</p>

<p>o Minor features (other):<br>
 - When we&#39;re not serving v2 directory information, there is no reason<br>
 to actually keep any around. Remove the obsolete files and directory<br>
 on startup if they are very old and we aren&#39;t going to serve them.<br>
 - When we negotiate a v2 link-layer connection (not yet implemented),<br>
 accept RELAY_EARLY cells and turn them into RELAY cells if we&#39;ve<br>
 negotiated a v1 connection for their next step. Initial steps for<br>
 proposal 110.<br>
 - When we have no consensus, check FallbackNetworkstatusFile (defaults<br>
 to $PREFIX/share/tor/fallback-consensus) for a consensus. This way<br>
 we can start out knowing some directory caches. We don&#39;t ship with<br>
 a fallback consensus by default though, because it was making<br>
 bootstrapping take too long while we tried many down relays.<br>
 - Authorities send back an X-Descriptor-Not-New header in response to<br>
 an accepted-but-discarded descriptor upload. Partially implements<br>
 fix for bug 535.<br>
 - If we find a cached-routers file that&#39;s been sitting around for more<br>
 than 28 days unmodified, then most likely it&#39;s a leftover from<br>
 when we upgraded to 0.2.0.8-alpha. Remove it. It has no good<br>
 routers anyway.<br>
 - When we (as a cache) download a descriptor because it was listed<br>
 in a consensus, remember when the consensus was supposed to expire,<br>
 and don&#39;t expire the descriptor until then.<br>
 - Optionally (if built with -DEXPORTMALLINFO) export the output<br>
 of mallinfo via http, as tor/mallinfo.txt. Only accessible<br>
 from localhost.<br>
 - Tag every guard node in our state file with the version that<br>
 we believe added it, or with our own version if we add it. This way,<br>
 if a user temporarily runs an old version of Tor and then switches<br>
 back to a new one, she doesn&#39;t automatically lose her guards.<br>
 - When somebody requests a list of statuses or servers, and we have<br>
 none of those, return a 404 rather than an empty 200.<br>
 - Merge in some (as-yet-unused) IPv6 address manipulation code. (Patch<br>
 from croup.)<br>
 - Add an HSAuthorityRecordStats option that hidden service authorities<br>
 can use to track statistics of overall hidden service usage without<br>
 logging information that would be as useful to an attacker.<br>
 - Allow multiple HiddenServicePort directives with the same virtual<br>
 port; when they occur, the user is sent round-robin to one<br>
 of the target ports chosen at random. Partially fixes bug 393 by<br>
 adding limited ad-hoc round-robining.<br>
 - Revamp file-writing logic so we don&#39;t need to have the entire<br>
 contents of a file in memory at once before we write to disk. Tor,<br>
 meet stdio.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (other):<br>
 - Alter the code that tries to recover from unhandled write<br>
 errors, to not try to flush onto a socket that&#39;s given us<br>
 unhandled errors.<br>
 - Directory mirrors no longer include a guess at the client&#39;s IP<br>
 address if the connection appears to be coming from the same /24<br>
 network; it was producing too many wrong guesses.<br>
 - If we&#39;re trying to flush the last bytes on a connection (for<br>
 example, when answering a directory request), reset the<br>
 time-to-give-up timeout every time we manage to write something<br>
 on the socket.<br>
 - Reject router descriptors with out-of-range bandwidthcapacity or<br>
 bandwidthburst values.<br>
 - If we can&#39;t expand our list of entry guards (e.g. because we&#39;re<br>
 using bridges or we have StrictEntryNodes set), don&#39;t mark relays<br>
 down when they fail a directory request. Otherwise we&#39;re too quick<br>
 to mark all our entry points down.<br>
 - Authorities no longer send back &quot;400 you&#39;re unreachable please fix<br>
 it&quot; errors to Tor servers that aren&#39;t online all the time. We&#39;re<br>
 supposed to tolerate these servers now.<br>
 - Let directory authorities startup even when they can&#39;t generate<br>
 a descriptor immediately, e.g. because they don&#39;t know their<br>
 address.<br>
 - Correctly enforce that elements of directory objects do not appear<br>
 more often than they are allowed to appear.<br>
 - Stop allowing hibernating servers to be &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;.<br>
 - On Windows, we were preventing other processes from reading<br>
 cached-routers while Tor was running. (Reported by janbar)<br>
 - Check return values from pthread_mutex functions.<br>
 - When opening /dev/null in finish_daemonize(), do not pass the<br>
 O_CREAT flag. Fortify was complaining, and correctly so. Fixes<br>
 bug 742; fix from Michael Scherer. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre19.</p>

<p>o Controller features:<br>
 - The GETCONF command now escapes and quotes configuration values<br>
 that don&#39;t otherwise fit into the torrc file.<br>
 - The SETCONF command now handles quoted values correctly.<br>
 - Add &quot;GETINFO/desc-annotations/id/≤OR digest&gt;&quot; so controllers can<br>
 ask about source, timestamp of arrival, purpose, etc. We need<br>
 something like this to help Vidalia not do GeoIP lookups on bridge<br>
 addresses.<br>
 - Allow multiple HashedControlPassword config lines, to support<br>
 multiple controller passwords.<br>
 - Accept LF instead of CRLF on controller, since some software has a<br>
 hard time generating real Internet newlines.<br>
 - Add GETINFO values for the server status events<br>
 &quot;REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED&quot; and &quot;GOOD_SERVER_DESCRIPTOR&quot;. Patch from<br>
 Robert Hogan.<br>
 - There is now an ugly, temporary &quot;desc/all-recent-extrainfo-hack&quot;<br>
 GETINFO for Torstat to use until it can switch to using extrainfos.<br>
 - New config option CookieAuthFile to choose a new location for the<br>
 cookie authentication file, and config option<br>
 CookieAuthFileGroupReadable to make it group-readable.<br>
 - Add a SOURCE_ADDR field to STREAM NEW events so that controllers can<br>
 match requests to applications. Patch from Robert Hogan.<br>
 - Add a RESOLVE command to launch hostname lookups. Original patch<br>
 from Robert Hogan.<br>
 - Add GETINFO status/enough-dir-info to let controllers tell whether<br>
 Tor has downloaded sufficient directory information. Patch from Tup.<br>
 - You can now use the ControlSocket option to tell Tor to listen for<br>
 controller connections on Unix domain sockets on systems that<br>
 support them. Patch from Peter Palfrader.<br>
 - New &quot;GETINFO address-mappings/*&quot; command to get address mappings<br>
 with expiry information. &quot;addr-mappings/*&quot; is now deprecated.<br>
 Patch from Tup.<br>
 - Add a new config option __DisablePredictedCircuits designed for<br>
 use by the controller, when we don&#39;t want Tor to build any circuits<br>
 preemptively.<br>
 - Let the controller specify HOP=%d as an argument to ATTACHSTREAM,<br>
 so we can exit from the middle of the circuit.<br>
 - Implement &quot;getinfo status/circuit-established&quot;.<br>
 - Implement &quot;getinfo status/version/...&quot; so a controller can tell<br>
 whether the current version is recommended, and whether any versions<br>
 are good, and how many authorities agree. Patch from &quot;shibz&quot;.<br>
 - Controllers should now specify cache=no or cache=yes when using<br>
 the +POSTDESCRIPTOR command.<br>
 - Add a &quot;PURPOSE=&quot; argument to &quot;STREAM NEW&quot; events, as suggested by<br>
 Robert Hogan. Fixes the first part of bug 681.<br>
 - When reporting clock skew, and we know that the clock is _at least<br>
 as skewed_ as some value, but we don&#39;t know the actual value,<br>
 report the value as a &quot;minimum skew.&quot;</p>

<p>o Controller bugfixes:<br>
 - Generate &quot;STATUS_SERVER&quot; events rather than misspelled<br>
 &quot;STATUS_SEVER&quot; events. Caught by mwenge.<br>
 - Reject controller commands over 1MB in length, so rogue<br>
 processes can&#39;t run us out of memory.<br>
 - Change the behavior of &quot;getinfo status/good-server-descriptor&quot;<br>
 so it doesn&#39;t return failure when any authority disappears.<br>
 - Send NAMESERVER_STATUS messages for a single failed nameserver<br>
 correctly.<br>
 - When the DANGEROUS_VERSION controller status event told us we&#39;re<br>
 running an obsolete version, it used the string &quot;OLD&quot; to describe<br>
 it. Yet the &quot;getinfo&quot; interface used the string &quot;OBSOLETE&quot;. Now use<br>
 &quot;OBSOLETE&quot; in both cases.<br>
 - Respond to INT and TERM SIGNAL commands before we execute the<br>
 signal, in case the signal shuts us down. We had a patch in<br>
 0.1.2.1-alpha that tried to do this by queueing the response on<br>
 the connection&#39;s buffer before shutting down, but that really<br>
 isn&#39;t the same thing at all. Bug located by Matt Edman.<br>
 - Provide DNS expiry times in GMT, not in local time. For backward<br>
 compatibility, ADDRMAP events only provide GMT expiry in an extended<br>
 field. &quot;GETINFO address-mappings&quot; always does the right thing.<br>
 - Use CRLF line endings properly in NS events.<br>
 - Make &#39;getinfo fingerprint&#39; return a 551 error if we&#39;re not a<br>
 server, so we match what the control spec claims we do. Reported<br>
 by daejees.<br>
 - Fix a typo in an error message when extendcircuit fails that<br>
 caused us to not follow the \r\n-based delimiter protocol. Reported<br>
 by daejees.<br>
 - When tunneling an encrypted directory connection, and its first<br>
 circuit fails, do not leave it unattached and ask the controller<br>
 to deal. Fixes the second part of bug 681.<br>
 - Treat some 403 responses from directory servers as INFO rather than<br>
 WARN-severity events.</p>

<p>o Portability / building / compiling:<br>
 - When building with --enable-gcc-warnings, check for whether Apple&#39;s<br>
 warning &quot;-Wshorten-64-to-32&quot; is available.<br>
 - Support compilation to target iPhone; patch from cjacker huang.<br>
 To build for iPhone, pass the --enable-iphone option to configure.<br>
 - Detect non-ASCII platforms (if any still exist) and refuse to<br>
 build there: some of our code assumes that &#39;A&#39; is 65 and so on.<br>
 - Clear up some MIPSPro compiler warnings.<br>
 - Make autoconf search for libevent, openssl, and zlib consistently.<br>
 - Update deprecated macros in configure.in.<br>
 - When warning about missing headers, tell the user to let us<br>
 know if the compile succeeds anyway, so we can downgrade the<br>
 warning.<br>
 - Include the current subversion revision as part of the version<br>
 string: either fetch it directly if we&#39;re in an SVN checkout, do<br>
 some magic to guess it if we&#39;re in an SVK checkout, or use<br>
 the last-detected version if we&#39;re building from a .tar.gz.<br>
 Use this version consistently in log messages.<br>
 - Correctly report platform name on Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 SE.<br>
 - Read resolv.conf files correctly on platforms where read() returns<br>
 partial results on small file reads.<br>
 - Build without verbose warnings even on gcc 4.2 and 4.3.<br>
 - On Windows, correctly detect errors when listing the contents of<br>
 a directory. Fix from lodger.<br>
 - Run &#39;make test&#39; as part of &#39;make dist&#39;, so we stop releasing so<br>
 many development snapshots that fail their unit tests.<br>
 - Add support to detect Libevent versions in the 1.4.x series<br>
 on mingw.<br>
 - Add command-line arguments to unit-test executable so that we can<br>
 invoke any chosen test from the command line rather than having<br>
 to run the whole test suite at once; and so that we can turn on<br>
 logging for the unit tests.<br>
 - Do not automatically run configure from autogen.sh. This<br>
 non-standard behavior tended to annoy people who have built other<br>
 programs.<br>
 - Fix a macro/CPP interaction that was confusing some compilers:<br>
 some GCCs don&#39;t like #if/#endif pairs inside macro arguments.<br>
 Fixes bug 707.<br>
 - Fix macro collision between OpenSSL 0.9.8h and Windows headers.<br>
 Fixes bug 704; fix from Steven Murdoch.<br>
 - Correctly detect transparent proxy support on Linux hosts that<br>
 require in.h to be included before netfilter_ipv4.h. Patch<br>
 from coderman.</p>

<p>o Logging improvements:<br>
 - When we haven&#39;t had any application requests lately, don&#39;t bother<br>
 logging that we have expired a bunch of descriptors.<br>
 - When attempting to open a logfile fails, tell us why.<br>
 - Only log guard node status when guard node status has changed.<br>
 - Downgrade the 3 most common &quot;INFO&quot; messages to &quot;DEBUG&quot;. This will<br>
 make &quot;INFO&quot; 75% less verbose.<br>
 - When SafeLogging is disabled, log addresses along with all TLS<br>
 errors.<br>
 - Report TLS &quot;zero return&quot; case as a &quot;clean close&quot; and &quot;IO error&quot;<br>
 as a &quot;close&quot;. Stop calling closes &quot;unexpected closes&quot;: existing<br>
 Tors don&#39;t use SSL_close(), so having a connection close without<br>
 the TLS shutdown handshake is hardly unexpected.<br>
 - When we receive a consensus from the future, warn about skew.<br>
 - Make &quot;not enough dir info yet&quot; warnings describe *why* Tor feels<br>
 it doesn&#39;t have enough directory info yet.<br>
 - On the USR1 signal, when dmalloc is in use, log the top 10 memory<br>
 consumers. (We already do this on HUP.)<br>
 - Give more descriptive well-formedness errors for out-of-range<br>
 hidden service descriptor/protocol versions.<br>
 - Stop recommending that every server operator send mail to tor-ops.<br>
 Resolves bug 597. Bugfix on 0.1.2.x.<br>
 - Improve skew reporting: try to give the user a better log message<br>
 about how skewed they are, and how much this matters.<br>
 - New --quiet command-line option to suppress the default console log.<br>
 Good in combination with --hash-password.<br>
 - Don&#39;t complain that &quot;your server has not managed to confirm that its<br>
 ports are reachable&quot; if we haven&#39;t been able to build any circuits<br>
 yet.<br>
 - Detect the reason for failing to mmap a descriptor file we just<br>
 wrote, and give a more useful log message. Fixes bug 533.<br>
 - Always prepend &quot;Bug: &quot; to any log message about a bug.<br>
 - When dumping memory usage, list bytes used in buffer memory<br>
 free-lists.<br>
 - When running with dmalloc, dump more stats on hup and on exit.<br>
 - Put a platform string (e.g. &quot;Linux i686&quot;) in the startup log<br>
 message, so when people paste just their logs, we know if it&#39;s<br>
 OpenBSD or Windows or what.<br>
 - When logging memory usage, break down memory used in buffers by<br>
 buffer type.<br>
 - When we are reporting the DirServer line we just parsed, we were<br>
 logging the second stanza of the key fingerprint, not the first.<br>
 - Even though Windows is equally happy with / and \ as path separators,<br>
 try to use \ consistently on Windows and / consistently on Unix: it<br>
 makes the log messages nicer.<br>
 - On OSX, stop warning the user that kqueue support in libevent is<br>
 &quot;experimental&quot;, since it seems to have worked fine for ages.</p>

<p>o Contributed scripts and tools:<br>
 - Update linux-tor-prio.sh script to allow QoS based on the uid of<br>
 the Tor process. Patch from Marco Bonetti with tweaks from Mike<br>
 Perry.<br>
 - Include the &quot;tor-ctrl.sh&quot; bash script by Stefan Behte to provide<br>
 Unix users an easy way to script their Tor process (e.g. by<br>
 adjusting bandwidth based on the time of the day).<br>
 - In the exitlist script, only consider the most recently published<br>
 server descriptor for each server. Also, when the user requests<br>
 a list of servers that _reject_ connections to a given address,<br>
 explicitly exclude the IPs that also have servers that accept<br>
 connections to that address. Resolves bug 405.<br>
 - Include a new contrib/tor-exit-notice.html file that exit relay<br>
 operators can put on their website to help reduce abuse queries.</p>

<p>o Newly deprecated features:<br>
 - The status/version/num-versioning and status/version/num-concurring<br>
 GETINFO controller options are no longer useful in the v3 directory<br>
 protocol: treat them as deprecated, and warn when they&#39;re used.<br>
 - The RedirectExits config option is now deprecated.</p>

<p>o Removed features:<br>
 - Drop the old code to choke directory connections when the<br>
 corresponding OR connections got full: thanks to the cell queue<br>
 feature, OR conns don&#39;t get full any more.<br>
 - Remove the old &quot;dns worker&quot; server DNS code: it hasn&#39;t been default<br>
 since 0.1.2.2-alpha, and all the servers are using the new<br>
 eventdns code.<br>
 - Remove the code to generate the oldest (v1) directory format.<br>
 - Remove support for the old bw_accounting file: we&#39;ve been storing<br>
 bandwidth accounting information in the state file since<br>
 0.1.2.5-alpha. This may result in bandwidth accounting errors<br>
 if you try to upgrade from 0.1.1.x or earlier, or if you try to<br>
 downgrade to 0.1.1.x or earlier.<br>
 - Drop support for OpenSSL version 0.9.6. Just about nobody was using<br>
 it, it had no AES, and it hasn&#39;t seen any security patches since<br>
 2004.<br>
 - Stop overloading the circuit_t.onionskin field for both &quot;onionskin<br>
 from a CREATE cell that we are waiting for a cpuworker to be<br>
 assigned&quot; and &quot;onionskin from an EXTEND cell that we are going to<br>
 send to an OR as soon as we are connected&quot;. Might help with bug 600.<br>
 - Remove the tor_strpartition() function: its logic was confused,<br>
 and it was only used for one thing that could be implemented far<br>
 more easily.<br>
 - Remove the contrib scripts ExerciseServer.py, PathDemo.py,<br>
 and TorControl.py, as they use the old v0 controller protocol,<br>
 and are obsoleted by TorFlow anyway.<br>
 - Drop support for v1 rendezvous descriptors, since we never used<br>
 them anyway, and the code has probably rotted by now. Based on<br>
 patch from Karsten Loesing.<br>
 - Stop allowing address masks that do not correspond to bit prefixes.<br>
 We have warned about these for a really long time; now it&#39;s time<br>
 to reject them. (Patch from croup.)<br>
 - Remove an optimization in the AES counter-mode code that assumed<br>
 that the counter never exceeded 2^68. When the counter can be set<br>
 arbitrarily as an IV (as it is by Karsten&#39;s new hidden services<br>
 code), this assumption no longer holds.<br>
 - Disable the SETROUTERPURPOSE controller command: it is now<br>
 obsolete.</p>
