<h1>Trip Report White House Forum to Combat Human Trafficking, 09 April 2013</h1>

<p>I was invited to attend the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/04/10/working-together-combat-human-trafficking">White House Forum to Combat Human Trafficking</a>. I&#39;ve been part of a task force to look at the role of technology in human trafficking. Secretary of State John Kerry sent <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/04/207232.htm">a video</a> since he was in another country at the time. A local Tor volunteer from Cambridge, Massachusetts has White House Press credentials and was able to <a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/WhiteHouseTor">cover the event</a>. This article is a better writeup and interview, with video, than anything else I&#39;ve seen covering the event. Interestingly, no other press showed up to cover the event. It seems <a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/">CCTV Cambridge</a> was the only press covering this White House initiative.</p>

<p>The room was full of a mix of people from law enforcement, human rights organizations, legal firms, and commercial companies. Eric Holder, Attorney General of US, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of DHS, and Cecilia Munoz, Director of Domestic Policy Council, all gave speeches about what their respective organizations are doing to fight trafficking. The US Dept of Health and Human Services is the main organization behind all of this. Their <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/endtrafficking">end trafficking</a> site is a fine starting point.</p>

<p>As far as my role, it&#39;s been to think about how technology is being used by traffickers and how victims could get help in their situations. <a href="http://wearethorn.org/aboutus/">Thorn</a>, <a href="http://www.fairgirls.org/">FAIR Girls</a>, and <a href="http://www.polarisproject.org/media-center/press-releases/757-texting-increases-human-trafficking-victims-access-to-help">Polaris</a> are all working on solutions and gathering raw data to support decisions.</p>

<p>I then spent some time talking to various organizations in DC and helping to explain Tor to more law enforcement.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a good day trip to DC.</p>
