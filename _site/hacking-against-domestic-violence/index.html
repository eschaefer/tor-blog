          <h2>Hacking Against Domestic Violence</h2>
<p class="meta">18 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="event">
<p>This January the Tor Project is supporting the <a href="http://vdhackathon.org">Central America Domestic Violence Hackathon</a>. The goal of this effort is to address the challenge of domestic violence by building technology solutions to assist agencies that work to support victims and advance efforts to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p>This is being done by supporting communities on the ground in six Central America countries and Washington, DC. Already some of the organizations involved, including <a href="http://secondmuse.com">SecondMuse</a> and the <a href="http://worldbank.org">World Bank</a>, have worked with these communities to define problems with potential for technical solutions. Next, these problems will be refined and then hacked on at a series of coordinated hackathons on January 26th and 27th, 2013.</p>

<p>We want to invite the Tor community to join us in this process. How can you help? There are two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Join the collaboration around defining strong problems. You can do this by reading the <a href="http://vdhackathon.pbworks.com/w/page/61682446/FrontPage">problem definitions</a> and adding your comments, questions, and ideas. These problems have been generated primarily by non-technical organizations and your insight from a technical perspective can be invaluable. This includes feasibility, use cases, privacy and security concerns, existing solutions, and more.</li>
<li>Join us on January 26th and 27th in one of the seven locations: <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680867601">Guatemala</a>, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680929787">El Salvador</a>, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680947841">Honduras</a>, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680961883">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680917751">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680981943">Panama</a>, or <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4680815445">Washington, DC</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We believe we can make a difference on domestic violence, and we need you.</p>

<p>Finally, if you&#39;d like to get involved on a deeper level by organizing a problem refinement event, meeting with organizations in these locations, helping organize a hackathon, or more - contact the team running this project at <a href="mailto:vdhackathon@secondmuse.com">vdhackathon@secondmuse.com</a>.</p>
