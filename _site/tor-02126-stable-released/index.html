               <h2>Tor 0.2.1.26-stable released</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jun 2010</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Tor 0.2.1.26 addresses the recent connection and memory overload problems we&#39;ve been seeing on relays, especially relays with their DirPort open. If your relay has been crashing, or you turned it off because it used too many resources, give this release a try.</p>

<p>This release also fixes yet another instance of broken OpenSSL libraries that was causing some relays to drop out of the consensus.</p>

<p>Available for download at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.26<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Teach relays to defend themselves from connection overload. Relays<br>
now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were intended<br>
for directory fetches. Relays are also more aggressive about closing<br>
TLS connections that have no circuits on them. Such circuits are<br>
unlikely to be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling<br>
up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets<br>
and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling<br>
their directory fetches over TLS).</li>
<li>Fix SSL renegotiation behavior on OpenSSL versions like on Centos<br>
that claim to be earlier than 0.9.8m, but which have in reality<br>
backported huge swaths of 0.9.8m or 0.9.8n renegotiation<br>
behavior. Possible fix for some cases of bug 1346.</li>
<li>Directory mirrors were fetching relay descriptors only from v2<br>
directory authorities, rather than v3 authorities like they should.<br>
Only 2 v2 authorities remain (compared to 7 v3 authorities), leading<br>
to a serious bottleneck. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha. Fixes bug 1324.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally get rid of the deprecated and now harmful notion of &quot;clique<br>
mode&quot;, where directory authorities maintain TLS connections to<br>
every other relay.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testsuite fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In the util/threads test, no longer free the test_mutex before all<br>
worker threads have finished. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>The master thread could starve the worker threads quite badly on<br>
certain systems, causing them to run only partially in the allowed<br>
window. This resulted in test failures. Now the master thread sleeps<br>
occasionally for a few microseconds while the two worker-threads<br>
compete for the mutex. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>
