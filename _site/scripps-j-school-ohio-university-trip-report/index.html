<p>Ohio University EW Scripps Journalism School Trip Report for 07 to 09 November 2012</p>

<p>Danny O&#39;Brien of <a href="https://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> and I were invited to talk to journalism students at the <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/">E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a> in <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/">Ohio University</a>. The topics were around computer security risks and protections from the perspective of journalists. CPJ maintains a great guide for reporters to survive dangerous situations appropriately called the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php">Journalist Security Guide</a>. This covers both offline and online situations. My role was to highlight the experience of Tor, what we&#39;ve seen, and how we&#39;ve protected both citizen and professional journalists the world over. I also covered using <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> as one tool in your toolbox to let you do the work of a journalist from anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20alexanda">Andy Alexander</a> was our host for the three days. We started off with a great dinner to share information about what both Danny and I have learned over the past few years in working with journalists. Andy has a long career of experience in foreign correspondence and reporting. His experiences covering a few decades highlight the need for journalists to learn how to protect themselves when reporting anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The next day was a first-year class about journalism in general. Danny and I presented to around 200 students. The computer couldn&#39;t read my USB drive, so I couldn&#39;t use <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2012-11-08-Scripps-IIJ-Presentation.pdf">my presentation</a>, rather I used the website to quickly cover Tor, how it works, and why journalists should care. I then discussed a range of attacks against an individual from fairly basic malware infections through more advanced traffic analysis and content swapping. My <a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox">PirateBox</a> did work, so anyone could get the presentations and copies of Tor locally if they so desired.</p>

<p>We had a great lunch with <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20kalyango">Professor Kalyango</a> and then head off to <a href="http://woub.org/news">WOUB</a> for a 30 minute podcast/radio interview.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we went off to the main panel event to talk to fourth year and graduate students about online security and the risks for journalists. Once again, the USB drive couldn&#39;t be read, but the <a href="http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox">PirateBox</a> worked fine. The lecture lasted around 90 minutes with a Q&amp;A session. Unlike the freshman class, a number of people had questions or wanted to verify what Danny and I stated.</p>

<p>We were then taken out to dinner by the top students at the J School. It was a great Middle Eastern kabob place to have an hour of discussions with the students.</p>

<p>And thanks to <a href="http://www.athensinteractivist.com/">Lindsay</a> for getting up at 06:30 to drive me to the airport and for the great discussion along the way. I look forward to reading her dispatches from East Africa in the near future.</p>
