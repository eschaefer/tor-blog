<p><strong>New releases, new hires, new funding</strong></p>

<p>Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha (released January 6) fixes two major bugs in bridge<br>
relays (one that would make the bridge relay not so useful if it had<br>
DirPort set to 0, and one that could let an attacker learn a little bit<br>
of information about the bridge&#39;s users), and a bug that would cause your<br>
Tor relay to ignore a circuit create request it can&#39;t decrypt (rather<br>
than reply with an error). It also fixes a wide variety of other bugs.<br>

<p>Tor 0.2.1.11-alpha (released Jan 20) finishes fixing the &quot;if your Tor is<br>
off for a week it will take a long time to bootstrap again&quot; bug. It also<br>
fixes an important security-related bug reported by Ilja van Sprundel. You<br>
should upgrade. (We&#39;ll send out more details about the bug once people<br>
have had some time to upgrade.)<br>

<p>Tor 0.2.0.33 (released Jan 21) fixes a variety of bugs that were making<br>
relays less useful to users. It also finally fixes a bug where a relay or<br>
client that&#39;s been off for many days would take a long time to bootstrap.<br>

<p>Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.8 (released Jan 22) updates Tor to 0.2.1.11-alpha<br>
(security update), updates OpenSSL to 0.9.8j (security update), updates<br>
Firefox to 3.0.5, updates Pidgin to 2.5.4, and updates libevent to 1.4.9.<br>
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/README" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/README">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/README</a></p>

<p>This month we also hired three new people: Martin Peck is working on<br>
Tor VM, a new way of packaging Tor on Windows that will let people use<br>
Youtube safely again; Mike Perry is working on Torbutton maintenance<br>
and development and on Torflow, a set of scripts to do measurements on<br>
the Tor network; and Andrew Lewman is our new executive director.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancements</strong><br>
Major bugfixes in the Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha and 0.2.0.33 releases:<br>
- If the cached networkstatus consensus is more than five days old,<br>
 discard it rather than trying to use it. In theory it could be useful<br>
 because it lists alternate directory mirrors, but in practice it just<br>
 means we spend many minutes trying directory mirrors that are long<br>
 gone from the network. Helps bug 887 a bit; bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha contains cleanups that let Tor build on Google&#39;s<br>
Android phone:<br>
- Change our header file guard macros to be less likely to conflict<br>
 with system headers. Adam Langley noticed that we were conflicting<br>
 with log.h on Android.</p>

<p>Major bugfixes in the Tor 0.2.1.11-alpha and 0.2.0.33 releases:<br>
- Discard router descriptors as we load them if they are more than<br>
 five days old. Otherwise if Tor is off for a long time and then<br>
 starts with cached descriptors, it will try to use the onion<br>
 keys in those obsolete descriptors when building circuits. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.0.x. Fixes bug 887.</p>

<p>Security bugfixes in the Tor 0.2.1.11-alpha and 0.2.0.33 releases:<br>
- Fix a heap-corruption bug that may be remotely triggerable on<br>
 some platforms. Reported by Ilja van Sprundel.</p>

<p>Circuit-building speedups in Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha:<br>
- When a relay gets a create cell it can&#39;t decrypt (e.g. because it&#39;s<br>
 using the wrong onion key), we were dropping it and letting the<br>
 client time out. Now actually answer with a destroy cell. Fixes<br>
 bug 904. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre8.</p>

<p>Scalability fixes from the Tor 0.2.0.33 ChangeLog:<br>
- Clip the MaxCircuitDirtiness config option to a minimum of 10 seconds,<br>
 and the CircuitBuildTimeout to a minimum of 30 seconds. Warn the user if<br>
 lower values are given in the configuration. These fixes prevent a user<br>
 from rebuilding circuits too often, which can be a denial-of-service<br>
 attack on the network.<br>
- When a stream at an exit relay is in state &quot;resolving&quot; or<br>
 &quot;connecting&quot; and it receives an &quot;end&quot; relay cell, the exit relay<br>
 would silently ignore the end cell and not close the stream. If<br>
 the client never closes the circuit, then the exit relay never<br>
 closes the TCP connection. Bug introduced in Tor 0.1.2.1-alpha;<br>
 reported by &quot;wood&quot;.<br>
- When sending CREATED cells back for a given circuit, use a 64-bit<br>
 connection ID to find the right connection, rather than an addr:port<br>
 combination. Now that we can have multiple OR connections between<br>
 the same ORs, it is no longer possible to use addr:port to uniquely<br>
 identify a connection.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping speedups in Tor 0.2.1.11-alpha:<br>
- When our circuit fails at the first hop (e.g. we get a destroy<br>
 cell back), avoid using that OR connection anymore, and also<br>
 tell all the one-hop directory requests waiting for it that they<br>
 should fail. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture</strong><br>
Proposal 158 (&quot;Clients download consensus + microdescriptors&quot;) suggests a<br>
new way forward for reducing directory overhead for clients, and replaced<br>
part of proposal 141. Rather than modifying the circuit-building protocol<br>
to fetch a server descriptor inline at each circuit extend, we instead put<br>
all of the information that clients need either into the consensus itself,<br>
or into a new set of data about each relay called a microdescriptor.<br>
 <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/158-microdescriptors.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/158-microdescriptors.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/spec/proposals/158-microdes...</a></p>

<p>From the 0.2.0.33 ChangeLog:<br>
- Never use OpenSSL compression: it wastes RAM and CPU trying to compress<br>
 cells, which are basically all encrypted, compressed, or both. It also<br>
 made us stand out from other applications on the wire.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-configured bundles</strong><br>
Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.8 (released Jan 22) updates Tor to 0.2.1.11-alpha<br>
(security update), updates OpenSSL to 0.9.8j (security update), updates<br>
Firefox to 3.0.5, updates Pidgin to 2.5.4, and updates libevent to 1.4.9.<br>

<p>We continued work on Vidalia features to support where we want Tor<br>
Browser Bundle to go. In particular, we&#39;re changing it to be able to<br>
launch Firefox natively, rather than use the &quot;PortableFirefox&quot; pile of<br>
complex scripts. We hope this change will also let users run a normal<br>
Firefox alongside TBB. More on that in February.</p>

<p>We also continued work on Tor VM, a new way of packaging Tor on<br>
Windows that will (among other things) let people use Youtube safely<br>
again. Hopefully we&#39;ll have some simple instructions up about that in<br>
February too.</p>

<p><strong>Bridges</strong><br>
Major bugfixes in the Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha and 0.2.0.33 releases:<br>
- Bridge relays that had DirPort set to 0 would stop fetching<br>
 descriptors shortly after startup, and then briefly resume<br>
 after a new bandwidth test and/or after publishing a new bridge<br>
 descriptor. Bridge users that try to bootstrap from them would<br>
 get a recent networkstatus but would get descriptors from up to<br>
 18 hours earlier, meaning most of the descriptors were obsolete<br>
 already. Reported by Tas; bugfix on 0.2.0.13-alpha.<br>
- Prevent bridge relays from serving their &#39;extrainfo&#39; document<br>
 to anybody who asks, now that extrainfo docs include potentially<br>
 sensitive aggregated client geoip summaries. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.0.13-alpha.</p>

<p>Bugfixes in the Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha release:<br>
- When we made bridge authorities stop serving bridge descriptors over<br>
 unencrypted links, we also broke DirPort reachability testing for<br>
 bridges. So bridges with a non-zero DirPort were printing spurious<br>
 warns to their logs. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Fixes bug 709.</p>

<p>New feature in Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha:<br>
- New controller event &quot;clients_seen&quot; to report a geoip-based summary<br>
 of which countries we&#39;ve seen clients from recently. Now controllers<br>
 like Vidalia can show bridge operators that they&#39;re actually making<br>
 a difference.<br>
Vidalia will add support for this feature in February.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate download methods</strong><br>

<p>Thandy itself is working smoothly at this point too -- it can contact<br>
the central repository, check all the keys, look in the registry and<br>
compare the currently installed version to the new choices, fetch the<br>
right packages, check all the signatures, and launch the install.</p>

<p>As of December we only had a new MSI-based installer for Tor, but not for<br>
Vidalia, Torbutton, or Polipo. Now we do, though it&#39;s still in testing:<br>

<p>We continued enhancements to the Chinese and Russian Tor website<br>
translations. Our Farsi translation from this summer is slowly becoming<br>
obsolete; we should solve that at some point.</p>
