<div class="post">
<p>We keep hearing from people around the world that clicking the 3 buttons to turn yourself into a bridge is too difficult todo for most users. These people have repeatedly asked for a &quot;bridge by default&quot; configuration in a package. Here it is: <a href="http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/" title="http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/">http://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/technology-preview/</a></p>

<p>When you install and run this package, you are a bridge relay helping censored users around the world access Tor and the uncensored Internet.<br>
To understand more about bridges, read <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges" title="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">https://www.torproject.org/bridges</a>.</p>

<p>This is the installable Vidalia bundle configured to be a bridge by default. This is Tor 0.2.2.13-alpha, Vidalia 0.2.9, Polipo 1.0.4.1. The only difference between this bridge-bundle and the vidalia-bundle is the bridge configuration.</p>

<p>When started, Vidalia attempts to use UPnP to reconfigure any NAT/router device to open port 9001 for tor and 9030 for a directory mirror. The bandwidth is set to consume greater than 1.5 Mbps. It works just like the vidalia-bundle (because it is the vidalia-bundle) where if UPnP fails, it prompts you to open the correct ports on your NAT/router.</p>

<p>None of this is final configuration. It is merely a &quot;does it work for you?&quot; test package. So far, it&#39;s worked on the 4 different networks I&#39;ve tried. Apologies to the 300 Chinese users who used my bridge on one of the test networks, only to have it go away a day later.</p>

<p><em>Update 2010-06-11: Fixed a vidalia.conf issue which wasn&#39;t a problem, but looked like the controlport was open and un-authenticated. uploaded new binaries and removed the old ones. The bridge-bundle nsi file that creates this bundle is <a href="https://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/trunk/pkg/win32/bridge-bundle.nsi.in">in Vidalia svn</a>. Just replace vidalia-bundle.nsi.in with the bridge-bundle.nsi.in and create your bundle.</em></p>
