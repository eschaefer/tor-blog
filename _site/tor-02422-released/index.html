<p class="meta">04 Jun 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This is a slightly belated announcement for the release of tor 0.2.4.22. Going into the future, we&#39;re planning to publish this information on the blog shortly after it is sent to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-announce">tor-announce</a>.</p>

<p>Release information is always published first on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk">tor-talk</a>.</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.4.22 backports numerous high-priority fixes from the Tor 0.2.5 alpha release series. These include blocking all authority signing keys that may have been affected by the OpenSSL &quot;heartbleed&quot; bug, choosing a far more secure set of TLS ciphersuites by default, closing a couple of memory leaks that could be used to run a target relay out of RAM, and several others.</p>

<p>Here is the complete changelog:  </p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.4.22 - 2014-05-16:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Major features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Block authority signing keys that were used on authorities<br>
vulnerable to the &quot;heartbleed&quot; bug in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160). (We<br>
don&#39;t have any evidence that these keys _were_ compromised; we&#39;re<br>
doing this to be prudent.) Resolves ticket 11464. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (security, OOM):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a memory leak that could occur if a microdescriptor parse<br>
fails during the tokenizing step. This bug could enable a memory<br>
exhaustion attack by directory servers. Fixes bug 11649; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.2.6-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Major bugfixes (TLS cipher selection, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>The relay ciphersuite list is now generated automatically based on<br>
uniform criteria, and includes all OpenSSL ciphersuites with<br>
acceptable strength and forward secrecy. Previously, we had left<br>
some perfectly fine ciphersuites unsupported due to omission or<br>
typo. Resolves bugs 11513, 11492, 11498, 11499. Bugs reported by<br>
&#39;cypherpunks&#39;. Bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.</li>
<li>Relays now trust themselves to have a better view than clients of<br>
which TLS ciphersuites are better than others. (Thanks to bug<br>
11513, the relay list is now well-considered, whereas the client<br>
list has been chosen mainly for anti-fingerprinting purposes.)<br>
Relays prefer: AES over 3DES; then ECDHE over DHE; then GCM over<br>
CBC; then SHA384 over SHA256 over SHA1; and last, AES256 over<br>
AES128. Resolves ticket 11528.</li>
<li>Clients now try to advertise the same list of ciphersuites as<br>
Firefox 28. This change enables selection of (fast) GCM<br>
ciphersuites, disables some strange old ciphers, and stops<br>
advertising the ECDH (not to be confused with ECDHE) ciphersuites.<br>
Resolves ticket 11438. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (configuration, security):</p>

<ul>
<li>When running a hidden service, do not allow TunneledDirConns 0:<br>
trying to set that option together with a hidden service would<br>
otherwise prevent the hidden service from running, and also make<br>
it publish its descriptors directly over HTTP. Fixes bug 10849;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (controller, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sending a garbage value to the controller when a circuit is<br>
cannibalized. Fixes bug 11519; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (exit relay, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop leaking memory when we successfully resolve a PTR record.<br>
Fixes bug 11437; bugfix on 0.2.4.7-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (bridge client, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid 60-second delays in the bootstrapping process when Tor is<br>
launching for a second time while using bridges. Fixes bug 9229;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (relays and bridges, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Give the correct URL in the warning message when trying to run a<br>
relay on an ancient version of Windows. Fixes bug 9393. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes (compilation):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a compilation error when compiling with --disable-curve25519.<br>
Fixes bug 9700; bugfix on 0.2.4.17-rc. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downgrade the warning severity for the the &quot;md was still<br>
referenced 1 node(s)&quot; warning. Tor 0.2.5.4-alpha has better code<br>
for trying to diagnose this bug, and the current warning in<br>
earlier versions of tor achieves nothing useful. Addresses warning<br>
from bug 7164. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (log verbosity, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>When we run out of usable circuit IDs on a channel, log only one<br>
warning for the whole channel, and describe how many circuits<br>
there were on the channel. Fixes part of ticket 11553. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minor features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Decrease the lower limit of MaxMemInCellQueues to 256 MBytes (but<br>
leave the default at 8GBytes), to better support Raspberry Pi<br>
users. Fixes bug 9686; bugfix on 0.2.4.14-alpha. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation (backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):</p>

<ul>
<li>Correctly document that we search for a system torrc file before<br>
looking in ~/.torrc. Fixes documentation side of 9213; bugfix on<br>
0.2.3.18-rc. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
