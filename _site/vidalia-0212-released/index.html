<p>The new release of Vidalia 0.2.12 is out. We&#39;d also like to congratulate Tom√°s Touceda on his first release and thank him for all his work and patience in getting this out!</p>

<p><strong>0.2.12 10-Apr-2011</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Vidalia&#39;s SVN repository has been migrated to Git. All branches but<br>
master have been archived for later review, since SVN trunk had changed<br>
significantly; they should be reviewed later to determine whether<br>
they can and should still be merged. All \version $Id$ headers have been<br>
removed since Git does not support $Id$.</li>
<li>As part of the move, Vidalia&#39;s Trac is now at:<br>
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/" title="https://trac.torproject.org/">https://trac.torproject.org/</a><br>
All Trac numbers in Vidalia 0.2.12 and beyond refer to the new Trac<br>
entries. The old Trac is archived for posterity at:<br>
<a href="https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia" title="https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia">https://trac-vidalia.torproject.org/projects/vidalia</a></li>
<li>Add support for Tor&#39;s ControlSocket as an alternative to ControlPort. It<br>
can be used for Linux maintainers to build a better default interaction<br>
between Tor and Vidalia by just setting the right permissions and file<br>
owner on the socket file for the connection. Using ControlSocket means<br>
you don&#39;t need to worry about authentication methods with ControlPort.<br>
Resolves bug 2091.</li>
<li>Add a way to edit arbitrary torrc entries while Tor is running. Now<br>
Vidalia users have more flexibility for configuring Tor. This change<br>
doesn&#39;t replace editing torrc directly, because on some systems<br>
(like Debian) Tor can&#39;t write to its torrc file. Resolves bug 2083.</li>
<li>Remove Vidalia&#39;s direct dependency on OpenSSL. This dependency had<br>
caused Vidalia to fail to run on FreeBSD (due to a bug in the FreeBSD<br>
ports collection) and Fedora 14 (due to an incompatibility between<br>
OpenSSL and Fedora&#39;s SELinux configuration). Resolves bug 2287 and<br>
2611.</li>
<li>Restore compatibility with Windows 2000. An update to the MiniUPnPc<br>
library had introduced an unnecessary dependency on a system library<br>
not included in Windows 2000. Fixes bug 2612.</li>
<li>Fix how the advanced message log window displays message updates when<br>
messages are coming in too quickly, for example when you&#39;re listening<br>
to debug-level messages from Tor. Fixes bug 2093.</li>
<li>Add a what&#39;s this? link to the bridge option to explain in a more verbose<br>
fashion what being a bridge involves. Resolves bug 1995.</li>
<li>Prompt users to restart Tor after changing the path to torrc. Fixes bug<br>
2086.</li>
<li>Disable the directory port configuration field when configuring a<br>
bridge. A bridge does not need to operate a separate directory port,<br>
and operating one can make a bridge easier to detect. Fixes bug 2431.</li>
<li>When Vidalia asks Tor for a bridge&#39;s usage history before anyone has<br>
used it, correctly report that no clients have used the bridge recently.<br>
Previously, it would incorrectly warn that it was unable to retrieve the<br>
bridge&#39;s usage history. Fixes bug 2186.</li>
