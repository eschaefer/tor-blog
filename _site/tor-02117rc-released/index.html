               <h2>Tor 0.2.1.17-rc released</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Jul 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Tor 0.2.1.17-rc marks the fourth -- and hopefully last -- release<br>
candidate for the 0.2.1.x series. It lays the groundwork for further<br>
client performance improvements, and also fixes a big bug with directory<br>
authorities that were causing them to assign Guard and Stable flags<br>
poorly.</p>

<p>The Windows bundles also finally include the geoip database that we<br>
thought we&#39;d been shipping since 0.2.0.x (oops), and the OS X bundles<br>
should actually install Torbutton rather than giving you a cryptic<br>
failure message (oops).</p>

<p>This is a release candidate! That means that we don&#39;t know of any<br>
remaining show-stopping bugs, and 0.2.1.18 will be the new stable if<br>
there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems<br>
that you find.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.17-rc - 2009-07-02<br>
<strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Clients now use the bandwidth values in the consensus, rather than<br>
the bandwidth values in each relay descriptor. This approach opens<br>
the door to more accurate bandwidth estimates once the directory<br>
authorities start doing active measurements. Implements more of<br>
proposal 141.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When Tor clients restart after 1-5 days, they discard all their<br>
cached descriptors as too old, but they still use the cached<br>
consensus document. This approach is good for robustness, but<br>
bad for performance: since they don&#39;t know any bandwidths, they<br>
end up choosing at random rather than weighting their choice by<br>
speed. Fixed by the above feature of putting bandwidths in the<br>
consensus. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Directory authorities were neglecting to mark relays down in their<br>
internal histories if the relays fall off the routerlist without<br>
ever being found unreachable. So there were relays in the histories<br>
that haven&#39;t been seen for eight months, and are listed as being<br>
up for eight months. This wreaked havoc on the &quot;median wfu&quot;<br>
and &quot;median mtbf&quot; calculations, in turn making Guard and Stable<br>
flags very wrong, hurting network performance. Fixes bugs 696 and<br>

<ol>
<li>Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Serve the DirPortFrontPage page even when we have been approaching<br>
our quotas recently. Fixes bug 1013; bugfix on 0.2.1.8-alpha.</li>
<li>The control port would close the connection before flushing long<br>
replies, such as the network consensus, if a QUIT command was issued<br>
before the reply had completed. Now, the control port flushes all<br>
pending replies before closing the connection. Also fixed a spurious<br>
warning when a QUIT command is issued after a malformed or rejected<br>
AUTHENTICATE command, but before the connection was closed. Patch<br>
by Marcus Griep. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x; fixes bugs 1015 and 1016.</li>
<li>When we can&#39;t find an intro key for a v2 hidden service descriptor,<br>
fall back to the v0 hidden service descriptor and log a bug message.<br>
Workaround for bug 1024.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we&#39;re a relay and we change our IP address, be more verbose<br>
about the reason that made us change. Should help track down<br>
further bugs for relays on dynamic IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
