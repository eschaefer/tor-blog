          <h2>Summer Conclusion (ARM Project)</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Sep 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Throughout the summer I&#39;ve been working on a project called &#39;arm&#39; (which stands for the &#39;anonymizing relay monitor&#39;). It&#39;s a real-time, terminal monitor for Tor relays providing bandwidth/cpu/memory usage, relay configuration, event log, connections, and other details relay operators might find handy for checking Tor&#39;s status. The project&#39;s intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone stuck with a tty terminal.</p>

<p>Source, screen shots, and a development log are available on the <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm">project&#39;s page</a> and an interview by Brenno Winter discussing the project is available <a href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/HFM_INT_0001.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p>The summer started with <a href="http://www.atagar.com/misc/gsocBlog09/">an application</a> to <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">GSoC 2009</a>. Though it wasn&#39;t accepted, in retrospect I wouldn&#39;t change a thing since looking for alternative ideas eventually led me to <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2008/msg00005.html">a thread by Jacob and Karsten from 2008</a> proposing a terminal relay monitor. Coding it has been a fantastic experience, providing the opportunity to dabble in a couple areas that are utterly new to me.</p>

<p>First, all my past experience with Python came from writing small scripts. However, what Jacob had termed a &quot;weekend project&quot; has grown to over 3,000 lines, with all the design and refactoring goodness that comes along with it. In particular this meant learning in intimate detail just how &quot;curses&quot; earned its name and writing wrappers to make up for its shortcomings.</p>

<p>Second, this was my first time working with an active, established open source community. While development was still mostly hacking out code amid Voodoo Daddy swing, having a community to bounce ideas off of and provide feedback made the work vastly more interesting and worthwhile. It was also my first experiences with anonymity systems and I&#39;d *highly* suggest the PETS conference to any future students interested in the field.</p>

<p>Barring the occasional bug fix or feature request the arm project is pretty well done so I&#39;m next off to the dreaded task of job hunting. Though I&#39;ll need to pull back the time I contribute to Tor, I&#39;m still hoping to stay active in the community. Thanks for the excellent summer - cheers! -Damian</p>
