          <h2>Why Tor is slow and what we're going to do about it</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Mar 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;ve just finished writing up an explanation of all the various reasons why the Tor network is slow, and what we can do about each. Part of it comes down to design flaws; some of it is that a handful of users are overloading the network; and there&#39;s also simply not enough capacity to go around.</p>

<p>Specifically, we&#39;ve identified six categories of problems to address, and laid out some steps to resolve each of them.</p>

<p>You can read the pdf here:<br>

<p>Andrew has also put together a real live <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2009-03-12-performance-roadmap-press-release">press release</a> to go with it.</p>

<p>Now all that remains is to do everything. So if you want to help, or especially if you know any organizations that can help with funding, please help us make this happen!</p>
