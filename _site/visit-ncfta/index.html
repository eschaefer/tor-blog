          <h2>A visit to NCFTA</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Jul 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I recently was invited to give a Tor talk at the <a href="http://www.ncfta.net/default2.asp">National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance</a>. Who is NCFTA? They are a non-profit that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>brings together local, state, and federal law enforcement, businesses, and academic institutions to functionally collaborate on cybercrime issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Tor talk was given to around 30 people who either investigate or use Tor daily as part of their role at NCFTA. The talk lasted around 2 hours with many questions. A handful of people hung out afterwards while I showed them the internals of Tor Browser Bundle (which circumvented their firewall just fine ;) and the Incognito LiveCD.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great visit to a bunch of smart people who need Tor to do their job safely.</p>
