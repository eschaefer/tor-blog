<p>Tor 0.2.0.35 fixes a big bug that was causing Tor relays with dynamic<br>
IP addresses to disappear from the network. It also fixes a rare crash<br>
bug on fast exit relays.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.35 - 2009-06-24<br>
<strong>Security fix:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid crashing in the presence of certain malformed descriptors.<br>
Found by lark, and by automated fuzzing.</li>
<li>Fix an edge case where a malicious exit relay could convince a<br>
controller that the client&#39;s DNS question resolves to an internal IP<br>
address. Bug found and fixed by &quot;optimist&quot;; bugfix on 0.1.2.8-beta.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally fix the bug where dynamic-IP relays disappear when their<br>
IP address changes: directory mirrors were mistakenly telling<br>
them their old address if they asked via begin_dir, so they<br>
never got an accurate answer about their new address, so they<br>
just vanished after a day. For belt-and-suspenders, relays that<br>
don&#39;t set Address in their config now avoid using begin_dir for<br>
all direct connections. Should fix bugs 827, 883, and 900.</li>
<li>Fix a timing-dependent, allocator-dependent, DNS-related crash bug<br>
that would occur on some exit nodes when DNS failures and timeouts<br>
occurred in certain patterns. Fix for bug 957.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When starting with a cache over a few days old, do not leak<br>
memory for the obsolete router descriptors in it. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.33; fixes bug 672.</li>
<li>Hidden service clients didn&#39;t use a cached service descriptor that<br>
was older than 15 minutes, but wouldn&#39;t fetch a new one either,<br>
because there was already one in the cache. Now, fetch a v2<br>
descriptor unless the same descriptor was added to the cache within<br>
the last 15 minutes. Fixes bug 997; reported by Marcus Griep.</li>
</ul>
