          <h2>Tor and the Silk Road takedown</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We&#39;ve had several requests by the press and others to talk about the Silk Road situation today. We only know what&#39;s going on by reading the same news sources everyone else is reading.</p>

<p>In this case we&#39;ve been watching carefully to try to learn if there are any flaws with Tor that we need to correct. So far, nothing about this case makes us think that there are new ways to compromise Tor (the software or the network). The FBI says that their suspect made mistakes in operational security, and was found through actual detective work. Remember: Tor does not anonymize individuals when they use their legal name on a public forum, use a VPN with logs that are subject to a subpoena, or provide personal information to other services. See also the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning">list of warnings linked from the Tor download page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, while we&#39;ve seen no evidence that this case involved breaking into the webserver behind the hidden service, we should take this opportunity to emphasize that Tor&#39;s hidden service feature (a way to publish and access content anonymously) won&#39;t keep someone anonymous when paired with unsafe software or unsafe behavior. It is up to the publisher to choose and configure server software that is resistant to attacks. Mistakes in configuring or maintaining a hidden service website can compromise the publisher&#39;s anonymity independent of Tor.</p>

<p>And finally, Tor&#39;s design goals include preventing even The Tor Project from tracking users; hidden services are no different. We don&#39;t have any special access to or information about this hidden service or any other. Because Tor is open-source and it comes with detailed design documents and research papers, independent researchers can verify its security.</p>
