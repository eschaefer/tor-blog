          <h2>On the Recent Growth of the Tor Network</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Jun 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>In the past few days the Tor network is seeing a lot of new users <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/measuring-tor-and-iran">coming from Iran</a>. At the same time we have heard from many people who want to support the Tor network by setting up more relays and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/bridges">bridges</a>. Now we wanted to know, are these just promises, or did the network really grow? Here are the results:</p>

<p>The number of relays has grown by 359 or 24% to now 1827 relays within only one week to the highest <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/dirarch/dirarch-2009-06-22.pdf">number of relays</a> the network has ever seen. Likewise, the <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/metrics/master/report/bridges/bridges-2009-06-22.pdf">number of bridges</a> has increased by an incredible 69 % from 255 to 432 within one week. Awesome!</p>

<p>So, does this mean everything is taken care of and no more relays or bridges are needed? Not at all! As you may know, Tor has some <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow">performance issues</a> that are, among other things, the result of too few bandwidth capacity for too many clients. If you can, go <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay">setup more relays and/or bridges</a> and keep them running even when the conflicts in the world do not hit the headlines. Be sure that your support is much appreciated!</p>
