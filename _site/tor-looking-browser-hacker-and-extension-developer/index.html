<div class="post">
<p>The Tor Project has two browser-related job openings available!</p>

<p>We are looking for a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en">C++ browser developer</a> to work on our Firefox-based browser, and a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-extdev.html.en">Firefox extension developer</a> to work on our growing number of Firefox extensions. Our ideal candidates would be comfortable in both roles, but we are also interested in hearing from people with either skillset.</p>

<p>On the C++ side, your tasks would include implementing new Firefox APIs and browser behavior changes; looking for and resolving web privacy issues; fixing bugs; responding on short notice to security issues; and helping to merge patches upstream.</p>

<p>On the extension development side, your primary tasks will include writing patches and UI improvements for Tor Birdy, Torbutton, HTTPS-Everywhere, Tor Launcher, and an OTR plugin for InstantBird. These improvements will primarily revolve around improving usability, Tor configuration, and security for our users.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to apply to the C++ position can be found on the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en">browser hacker job posting</a>. If you would prefer to focus on extension development, you should apply to the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-extdev.html.en">extension developer</a> position.</p>
