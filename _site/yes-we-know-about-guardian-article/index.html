<p>And also the Washington Post article.</p>

<p>We&#39;re planning to write up a more detailed analysis later, but for now here&#39;s a place to centralize all the &quot;hey did you know about this article&quot; blog comments.</p>

<p>And for the journalists out there who want a statement, here&#39;s my quote from the article:</p>

<p>&quot;The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there&#39;s no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network. Infecting the laptop, phone, or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard.</p>

<p>Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody&#39;s going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on.</p>

<p>Just using Tor isn&#39;t enough to keep you safe in all cases. Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.&quot;</p>
