<p>Tor 0.2.1.10-alpha fixes two major bugs in bridge relays (one that would<br>
make the bridge relay not so useful if it had DirPort set to 0, and one<br>
that could let an attacker learn a little bit of information about the<br>
bridge&#39;s users), and a bug that would cause your Tor relay to ignore a<br>
circuit create request it can&#39;t decrypt (rather than reply with an error).<br>
It also fixes a wide variety of other bugs.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.10-alpha - 2009-01-06<br>
<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If the cached networkstatus consensus is more than five days old,<br>
discard it rather than trying to use it. In theory it could<br>
be useful because it lists alternate directory mirrors, but in<br>
practice it just means we spend many minutes trying directory<br>
mirrors that are long gone from the network. Helps bug 887 a bit;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.0.x.</li>
<li>Bridge relays that had DirPort set to 0 would stop fetching<br>
descriptors shortly after startup, and then briefly resume<br>
after a new bandwidth test and/or after publishing a new bridge<br>
descriptor. Bridge users that try to bootstrap from them would<br>
get a recent networkstatus but would get descriptors from up to<br>
18 hours earlier, meaning most of the descriptors were obsolete<br>
already. Reported by Tas; bugfix on 0.2.0.13-alpha.</li>
<li>Prevent bridge relays from serving their &#39;extrainfo&#39; document<br>
to anybody who asks, now that extrainfo docs include potentially<br>
sensitive aggregated client geoip summaries. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.13-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New controller event &quot;clients_seen&quot; to report a geoip-based summary<br>
of which countries we&#39;ve seen clients from recently. Now controllers<br>
like Vidalia can show bridge operators that they&#39;re actually making<br>
a difference.</li>
<li>Build correctly against versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later built<br>
without support for deprecated functions.<br>

<ul>
<li>Update to the &quot;December 19 2008&quot; ip-to-country file.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Authorities now vote for the Stable flag for any router whose<br>
weighted MTBF is at least 5 days, regardless of the mean MTBF.</li>
<li>Do not remove routers as too old if we do not have any consensus<br>
document. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.</li>
<li>Do not accept incomplete ipv4 addresses (like 192.168.0) as valid.<br>
Spec conformance issue. Bugfix on Tor 0.0.2pre27.</li>
<li>When an exit relay resolves a stream address to a local IP address,<br>
do not just keep retrying that same exit relay over and<br>
over. Instead, just close the stream. Addresses bug 872. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.32. Patch from rovv.</li>
<li>If a hidden service sends us an END cell, do not consider<br>
retrying the connection; just close it. Patch from rovv.</li>
<li>When we made bridge authorities stop serving bridge descriptors over<br>
unencrypted links, we also broke DirPort reachability testing for<br>
bridges. So bridges with a non-zero DirPort were printing spurious<br>
warns to their logs. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Fixes bug 709.</li>
<li>When a relay gets a create cell it can&#39;t decrypt (e.g. because it&#39;s<br>
using the wrong onion key), we were dropping it and letting the<br>
client time out. Now actually answer with a destroy cell. Fixes<br>
bug 904. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre8.</li>
<li>Squeeze 2-5% out of client performance (according to oprofile) by<br>
improving the implementation of some policy-manipulation functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make get_interface_address() function work properly again; stop<br>
guessing the wrong parts of our address as our address.</li>
<li>Do not cannibalize a circuit if we&#39;re out of RELAY_EARLY cells to<br>
send on that circuit. Otherwise we might violate the proposal-110<br>
limit. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha. Partial fix for Bug 878. Diagnosis<br>
thanks to Karsten.</li>
<li>When we&#39;re sending non-EXTEND cells to the first hop in a circuit,<br>
for example to use an encrypted directory connection, we don&#39;t need<br>
to use RELAY_EARLY cells: the first hop knows what kind of cell<br>
it is, and nobody else can even see the cell type. Conserving<br>
RELAY_EARLY cells makes it easier to cannibalize circuits like<br>
this later.</li>
<li>Stop logging nameserver addresses in reverse order.</li>
<li>If we are retrying a directory download slowly over and over, do<br>
not automatically give up after the 254th failure. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.9-alpha.</li>
<li>Resume reporting accurate &quot;stream end&quot; reasons to the local control<br>
port. They were lost in the changes for Proposal 148. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.9-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deprecated and removed features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The old &quot;tor --version --version&quot; command, which would print out<br>
the subversion &quot;Id&quot; of most of the source files, is now removed. It<br>
turned out to be less useful than we&#39;d expected, and harder to<br>
maintain.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Change our header file guard macros to be less likely to conflict<br>
with system headers. Adam Langley noticed that we were conflicting<br>
with log.h on Android.</li>
<li>Tool-assisted documentation cleanup. Nearly every function or<br>
static variable in Tor should have its own documentation now.</li>
</ul>
