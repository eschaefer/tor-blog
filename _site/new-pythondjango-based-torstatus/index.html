          <h2>New Python/Django-based TorStatus</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Aug 2011</p>

<div class="event">
<p>We&#39;re excited to announce that a group of students from Wesleyan has created a new <a href="http://www.torstatusbeta.org/">TorStatus</a> website written in Python. Their new website is a fine addition to Kasimir Gabert&#39;s <a href="http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/">Tor Network Status</a> page. Kasimir&#39;s page is currently the most popular website to learn about running Tor relays.</p>

<p>We&#39;re glad that we now have a new Python/Django-based TorStatus, as many developers in the Tor community have been working on complementary Tor Python libraries.</p>

<p>The new TorStatus started out as a rewrite of the old PHP-based TorStatus, so we&#39;re building from Kasimir&#39;s great ideas. The new TorStatus adds a new landing page, paged results that decrease latency, and carefully crafted graphs with a focus on aesthetics. But it&#39;s not only the features that make this code so great. We believe that many more developers will be interested in modifying and extending the codebase! At least that&#39;s much simpler now with the move to Python/Django.</p>

<p>The new TorStatus project was done by <a href="http://ndanner.web.wesleyan.edu/">Norman Danner</a>&#39;s students during their summer <a href="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/summer-institute-2011">The Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software at Wesleyan University</a> course. Thanks to Jeremy, Diego, and Vlad for designing, coding, and testing this new TorStatus! Thanks to Damian for co-mentoring the students on Tor&#39;s side.</p>

<p>What&#39;s next? Want to help out with coding on the new TorStatus? You should start by looking at the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torstatus.git">codebase</a> and the list of open <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=TorStatus&amp;status=!closed">tickets</a>. Feel free to leave a comment here or drop by <a href="irc://irc.oftc.net/tor">#tor-dev</a> if you have suggestions or are interested in helping out!</p>
