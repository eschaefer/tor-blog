<div class="event">
<p>Tor 0.2.2.24-alpha fixes a variety of bugs, including a big bug that<br>
 prevented Tor clients from effectively using &quot;multihomed&quot; bridges,<br>
 that is, bridges that listen on multiple ports or IP addresses so users<br>
 can continue to use some of their addresses even if others get blocked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download" title="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical<br>
address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical<br>
address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it should be<br>
able to advertise those addresses independently and any non-blocked<br>
addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.x. Fixes<br>
bug 2510.</li>
<li>If you configured Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and<br>
configured Tor to use bridge B instead, it would happily continue<br>
to use bridge A if it&#39;s still reachable. While this behavior is<br>
a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it&#39;s a<br>
dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.</li>
<li>Directory authorities now use data collected from their own<br>
uptime observations when choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag<br>
to relays, instead of trusting the uptime value the relay reports in<br>
its descriptor. This change helps prevent an attack where a small<br>
set of nodes with frequently-changing identity keys can blackhole<br>
a hidden service. (Only authorities need upgrade; others will be<br>
fine once they do.) Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection<br>
from the outside before we&#39;ve started our reachability tests,<br>
triggering a warning: &quot;ORPort found reachable, but I have no<br>
routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success.&quot; This<br>
bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller<br>
like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a<br>
REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED status event. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha;<br>
fixes bug 1172.</li>
<li>Make directory authorities more accurate at recording when<br>
relays that have failed several reachability tests became<br>
unreachable, so we can provide more accuracy at assigning Stable,<br>
Guard, HSDir, etc flags. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Resolves bug 2716.<br>

<ul>
<li>Fix an issue that prevented static linking of libevent on<br>
some platforms (notably Linux). Fixes bug 2698; bugfix on<br>
versions 0.2.1.23/0.2.2.8-alpha (the versions introducing<br>
the --with-static-libevent configure option).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We now ask the other side of a stream (the client or the exit)<br>
for more data on that stream when the amount of queued data on<br>
that stream dips low enough. Previously, we wouldn&#39;t ask the<br>
other side for more data until either it sent us more data (which<br>
it wasn&#39;t supposed to do if it had exhausted its window!) or we<br>
had completely flushed all our queued data. This flow control fix<br>
should improve throughput. Fixes bug 2756; bugfix on the earliest<br>
released versions of Tor (svn commit r152).</li>
<li>Avoid a double-mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a<br>
transparent proxy connection. (We thought we had fixed this in<br>
0.2.2.23-alpha, but it turns out our fix was checking the wrong<br>
connection.) Fixes bug 2757; bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha (the original<br>
bug) and 0.2.2.23-alpha (the incorrect fix).</li>
<li>When warning about missing zlib development packages during compile,<br>
give the correct package names. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Directory authorities now log the source of a rejected POSTed v3<br>
networkstatus vote.</li>
<li>Make compilation with clang possible when using<br>
--enable-gcc-warnings by removing two warning optionss that clang<br>
hasn&#39;t implemented yet and by fixing a few warnings. Implements<br>
ticket 2696.</li>
<li>When expiring circuits, use microsecond timers rather than<br>
one-second timers. This can avoid an unpleasant situation where a<br>
circuit is launched near the end of one second and expired right<br>
near the beginning of the next, and prevent fluctuations in circuit<br>
timeout values.</li>
<li>Use computed circuit-build timeouts to decide when to launch<br>
parallel introduction circuits for hidden services. (Previously,<br>
we would retry after 15 seconds.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Create the /var/run/tor directory on startup on OpenSUSE if it is<br>
not already created. Patch from Andreas Stieger. Fixes bug 2573.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Modernize the doxygen configuration file slightly. Fixes bug 2707.</li>
<li>Resolve all doxygen warnings except those for missing documentation.<br>
Fixes bug 2705.</li>
<li>Add doxygen documentation for more functions, fields, and types.</li>
</ul>
