<p><strong>Tor 0.2.2.35 fixes a critical heap-overflow security issue in Tor&#39;s<br>
 buffers code. Absolutely everybody should upgrade.</strong></p>

<p>The bug relied on an incorrect calculation when making data continuous<br>
 in one of our IO buffers, if the first chunk of the buffer was<br>
 misaligned by just the wrong amount. The miscalculation would allow an<br>
 attacker to overflow a piece of heap-allocated memory. To mount this<br>
 attack, the attacker would need to either open a SOCKS connection to<br>
 Tor&#39;s SocksPort (usually restricted to localhost), or target a Tor<br>
 instance configured to make its connections through a SOCKS proxy<br>
 (which Tor does not do by default).</p>

<p>Good security practice requires that all heap-overflow bugs should be<br>
 presumed to be exploitable until proven otherwise, so we are treating<br>
 this as a potential code execution attack. Please upgrade immediately!<br>
 This bug does not affect bufferevents-based builds of Tor. Special<br>
 thanks to &quot;Vektor&quot; for reporting this issue to us!</p>

<p>Tor 0.2.2.35 also fixes several bugs in previous versions, including<br>
 crash bugs for unusual configurations, and a long-term bug that<br>
 would prevent Tor from starting on Windows machines with draconian<br>
 AV software.</p>

<p>With this release, we remind everyone that 0.2.0.x has reached its<br>
 formal end-of-life. Those Tor versions have many known flaws, and<br>
 nobody should be using them. You should upgrade -- ideally to the<br>
 0.2.2.x series. If you&#39;re using a Linux or BSD and its packages are<br>
 obsolete, stop using those packages and upgrade anyway.</p>

<p>The Tor 0.2.1.x series is also approaching its end-of-life: it will no<br>
 longer receive support after some time in early 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.35 - 2011-12-16</strong></p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a heap overflow bug that could occur when trying to pull<br>
data into the first chunk of a buffer, when that chunk had<br>
already had some data drained from it. Fixes CVE-2011-2778;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by &quot;Vektor&quot;.</li>
<li>Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so<br>
that it doesn&#39;t attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause<br>
some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for<br>
bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through<br>
2.0.15-stable.</li>
<li>If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,<br>
don&#39;t process any further cells on it. We already avoid further<br>
reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the<br>
cells we&#39;d already read. Fixes bug 4299; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha,<br>
which was the first version where we might mark a connection for<br>
close based on processing a cell on it.</li>
<li>Correctly sanity-check that we don&#39;t underflow on a memory<br>
allocation (and then assert) for hidden service introduction<br>
point decryption. Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak when we check whether a hidden service<br>
descriptor has any usable introduction points left. Fixes bug<br>

<ol>
<li>Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Don&#39;t crash when we&#39;re running as a relay and don&#39;t have a GeoIP<br>
file. Bugfix on 0.2.2.34; fixes bug 4340. This backports a fix<br>
we&#39;ve had in the 0.2.3.x branch already.</li>
<li>When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain<br>
wrong) log message that we&#39;re collecting &quot;directory request&quot;<br>
statistics: clients don&#39;t collect statistics. Also don&#39;t create a<br>
useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory. Fixes<br>
bug 4353; bugfix on 0.2.2.34.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Detect failure to initialize Libevent. This fix provides better<br>
detection for future instances of bug 4457.</li>
<li>Avoid frequent calls to the fairly expensive cull_wedged_cpuworkers<br>
function. This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some<br>
busy servers. Fixes bug 4518; bugfix on 0.0.9.8.</li>
<li>Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist_ensure_capacity().<br>
Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by<br>
Mansour Moufid.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn about unused log_mutex in log.c when building with<br>
--disable-threads using a recent GCC. Fixes bug 4437; bugfix on<br>
0.1.0.6-rc which introduced --disable-threads.</li>
<li>When configuring, starting, or stopping an NT service, stop<br>
immediately after the service configuration attempt has succeeded<br>
or failed. Fixes bug 3963; bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.</li>
<li>When sending a NETINFO cell, include the original address<br>
received for the other side, not its canonical address. Found<br>
by &quot;troll_un&quot;; fixes bug 4349; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix a typo in a hibernation-related log message. Fixes bug 4331;<br>
bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by &quot;tmpname0901&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak in launch_direct_bridge_descriptor_fetch() that<br>
occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge<br>
in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>
<li>Backport fixes for a pair of compilation warnings on Windows.<br>
Fixes bug 4521; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta and on 0.2.2.29-beta.</li>
<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str on an address of<br>
unknown type, we would have done a strdup on an uninitialized<br>
buffer. Now we won&#39;t. Fixes bug 4529; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.<br>
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Correctly detect and handle transient lookup failures from<br>
tor_addr_lookup. Fixes bug 4530; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.<br>
Reported by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.<br>
Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
<li>Use tor_socket_t type for listener argument to accept(). Fixes bug<br>
4535; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta. Found by &quot;troll_un&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add two new config options for directory authorities:<br>
AuthDirFastGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold for guaranteeing the<br>
Fast flag, and AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold<br>
that is always sufficient to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for<br>
the Guard flag. Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate<br>
Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.</li>
<li>When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,<br>
include the hidden service&#39;s directory in the warning message.<br>
Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service<br>
was ignored. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes bug 4426.</li>
<li>Update to the December 6 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make it easier to automate expert package builds on Windows,<br>
by removing an absolute path from makensis.exe command.</li>
</ul>
