<p>I was invited to talk for 90 minutes at NNEDV&#39;s <a href="http://nnedv.org/projects/safetynet/3701-techsummit2013.html">TechSummit 13</a> about privacy, helping victims, and Tor. My <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-07-30-NNEDV-Presentation.pdf">presentation</a> covered a quick overview of Tor, why I&#39;m here talking about domestic violence and intimate partner abuse, and what we&#39;re doing to help. I also included four case studies of which highlight the role of technology in stalking and abuse. Videos of my talk may make their way online at some point. At the request of the audience, I walked through my <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-01-27-WorldBank-fuerza-presentation.html">World Bank Hackathon</a> presentation to show how easy it is to infect a mobile phone and what an abuser will get out of such an action.</p>

<p>The conference was held at the great <a href="http://www.hayesmansion.com/">Hayes Mansion</a> which allowed for lots of informal conversations in a more relaxed atmosphere. The attendees are a mix of advocates from around the world, law enforcement, commercial companies (such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Verizon, Mozilla, etc), and a number of lawyers from public and private organizations.</p>

<p>I could only stay for one of the three-day conference, but once again, it was great to engage in conversations with people of all backgrounds. Many organizations are now more aware of Tor and interested in talking to us about using our technology and experience to help. Hopefully our continuing commitment to helping and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/ipv">past experience</a> in this area are beginning to make a difference.</p>

<p>Overall, it was great to be invited and worth the trip.</p>
