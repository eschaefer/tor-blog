          <h2>TorFlow Node Capacity, Integrity and Reliability Measurements at HotPETS</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/measuring-tor-network-public-directory-information">Like Karsten</a>, I too am presenting at <a href="http://petsymposium.org/2009/hotpets.php">HotPETS</a> in Seattle in August. My presentation will cover my work with my <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torflow/trunk/">TorFlow suite</a> - a python library and utility set to assist measuring and adjusting performance on the Tor network, and to scan the network for malfunctioning and misbehaving exits.</p>

<p>One of the highlights is a system for <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/160-bandwidth-offset.txt">performance feedback</a>: a set of <a href="https://git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/proposals/161-computing-bandwidth-adjustments.txt">training wheels of sorts</a> for Tor&#39;s load balancing algorithms that once deployed, should greatly improve the performance of the network for 0.2.1 clients. I am very much excited about this and am looking forward to throwing the switch on it in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Also of note is the discovery that nodes that use Tor&#39;s built in rate-limiting are far less likely to fail circuits than those that do not, especially for Windows nodes. So if you are a Windows node operator, please rate limit your node slightly below your connection&#39;s capacity using either the Vidalia GUI or the BandwidthRate torrc config option.. I will be emailing the contact info addresses of nodes that are most affected by this soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://fscked.org/talks/TorFlow-HotPETS-final.pdf">paper for the presentation</a> describes the library, utilities, and their results in much further detail.</p>
