          <h2>Circumvention and Anonymity</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Jan 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We&#39;ve always argued that safe circumvention requires anonymity, even from the circumvention service itself. There are many people wanting to record your Internet traffic and browsing patterns; from governments to commercial advertising networks. There are many ways to defeat the threat of traffic analysis; from simple proxy providers, virtual private networks, and distributed peer to peer solutions. Only some of these offer anonymity along with circumvention. Tor&#39;s open design and anonymity properties provide protections for the user from those watching the traffic and from us as an organization.</p>

<p>Our architecture and design don&#39;t force the user to assume trust in us. Our code is <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/">accessible</a> and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/LICENSE">licensed under an open license</a>. Our <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git">specifications</a> are clearly detailed and published. Our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download">packages</a> follow a defined build process so the user can create the same binaries we do. Independent researchers can and do test the properties Tor provides [and help us to improve]. Moreover, The Tor software runs on a distributed network, where a single operator cannot capture or be forced to capture all users&#39; traffic information, even under legal or coercive threat.</p>

<p>All of these should allow the user to trust The Tor Project as a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople">not-for-profit company</a> and to trust that Tor isn&#39;t surreptitiously watching the very information you&#39;re trying to protect and isn&#39;t gathering information we could be forced to disclose.</p>

<p>We&#39;re always willing to work with other organizations who understand that anonymity provides stronger circumvention protections than the alternatives.</p>
