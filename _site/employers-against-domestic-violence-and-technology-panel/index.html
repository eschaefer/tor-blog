          <h2>Employers Against Domestic Violence and Technology Panel</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Nov 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I was invited by <a href="http://employersagainstdomesticviolence.org/">Employers Against Domestic Violence</a> to give a talk about technology and stalking as part of a larger panel.</p>

<p>On Friday the 16th, I presented Tor and our work with victims of abuse and stalking to around 50 people. Most of my <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2012-11-16-EADV-Tech-Stalking-Advice.pdf">full presentation</a> covered the basics of Tor, a demo of <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails Live System</a>, and then some user stories. Most of the people in the audience were already DV advocates and aware of the way technology is used to harm or manipulate others. The user stories have come from a number of places, between phone calls, email support, and actually being out in the world talking to survivors or advocates who want to help.</p>

<p>I co-presented with Sarah from <a href="https://www.abine.com">Abine</a> and Valenda from <a href="http://gbls.org/">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>. All three of our presentations can be found on Tor&#39;s <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eandrew/2012-11-16-EADV/">people server</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a number of people came up to me to ask about getting Tails or Tor Browser, or to simply introduce themselves. I met a cyber-stalking survivor I&#39;ve only helped via email and phone over the past year or so. I look forward to doing more of these types of events locally.</p>
