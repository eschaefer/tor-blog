          <h2>Tor's Response to Prism Surveillance Program</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Jun 2013</p>

<div class="event">
<p>Due to several requests received today from members of the press community and others we felt it was in the best interest of time and consistency to provide a statement regarding today&#39;s developments and stories surrounding the NSA Prism surveillance program.</p>

<p>The Tor Project is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to providing tools to help people manage their privacy on the Internet. Beyond our free, open source technology and extensive research we actively foster important conversations with many global organizations in order to help people around the world understand the value of privacy and anonymity online. As a result, members of the core Tor team and the greater Tor community are out in the world sharing knowledge and insights with countless individuals every day - many times handing out free Tor stickers; with no donation requested or expected. Edward Snowden, like tens of thousands of people, put Tor stickers on their devices. He likely got it at a conference from one of us in the past year.</p>

<p>Today, as always, the team at Tor remains committed to building innovative, sustainable technology solutions to help keep the doors to freedom of expression open.</p>
