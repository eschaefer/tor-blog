               <h2>Tor 0.2.2.26-beta and 0.2.2.27-beta are out</h2>
<p class="meta">24 May 2011</p>

<div class="event">
<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.27-beta - 2011-05-18</strong><br>
 Tor 0.2.2.27-beta fixes a bridge-related stability bug in the previous<br>
 release, and also adds a few more general bugfixes.</p>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a crash bug when changing bridges in a running Tor process.<br>
Fixes bug 3213; bugfix on 0.2.2.26-beta.</li>
<li>When the controller configures a new bridge, don&#39;t wait 10 to 60<br>
seconds before trying to fetch its descriptor. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 3198 (suggested by 2355).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Require that onion keys have exponent 65537 in microdescriptors too.<br>
Fixes more of bug 3207; bugfix on 0.2.2.26-beta.</li>
<li>Tor used to limit HttpProxyAuthenticator values to 48 characters.<br>
Changed the limit to 512 characters by removing base64 newlines.<br>
Fixes bug 2752. Fix by Michael Yakubovich.</li>
<li>When a client starts or stops using bridges, never use a circuit<br>
that was built before the configuration change. This behavior could<br>
put at risk a user who uses bridges to ensure that her traffic<br>
only goes to the chosen addresses. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes<br>
bug 3200.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.26-beta - 2011-05-17</strong><br>
 Tor 0.2.2.26-beta fixes a variety of potential privacy problems. It<br>
 also introduces a new &quot;socksport auto&quot; approach that should make it<br>
 easier to run multiple Tors on the same system, and does a lot of<br>
 cleanup to get us closer to a release candidate.</p>

<p><strong>Security/privacy fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Replace all potentially sensitive memory comparison operations<br>
with versions whose runtime does not depend on the data being<br>
compared. This will help resist a class of attacks where an<br>
adversary can use variations in timing information to learn<br>
sensitive data. Fix for one case of bug 3122. (Safe memcmp<br>
implementation by Robert Ransom based partially on code by DJB.)</li>
<li>When receiving a hidden service descriptor, check that it is for<br>
the hidden service we wanted. Previously, Tor would store any<br>
hidden service descriptors that a directory gave it, whether it<br>
wanted them or not. This wouldn&#39;t have let an attacker impersonate<br>
a hidden service, but it did let directories pre-seed a client<br>
with descriptors that it didn&#39;t want. Bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>
<li>On SIGHUP, do not clear out all TrackHostExits mappings, client<br>
DNS cache entries, and virtual address mappings: that&#39;s what<br>
NEWNYM is for. Fixes bug 1345; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The options SocksPort, ControlPort, and so on now all accept a<br>
value &quot;auto&quot; that opens a socket on an OS-selected port. A<br>
new ControlPortWriteToFile option tells Tor to write its<br>
actual control port or ports to a chosen file. If the option<br>
ControlPortFileGroupReadable is set, the file is created as<br>
group-readable. Now users can run two Tor clients on the same<br>
system without needing to manually mess with parameters. Resolves<br>
part of ticket 3076.</li>
<li>Set SO_REUSEADDR on all sockets, not just listeners. This should<br>
help busy exit nodes avoid running out of useable ports just<br>
because all the ports have been used in the near past. Resolves<br>
issue 2850.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>New &quot;GETINFO net/listeners/(type)&quot; controller command to return<br>
a list of addresses and ports that are bound for listeners for a<br>
given connection type. This is useful when the user has configured<br>
&quot;SocksPort auto&quot; and the controller needs to know which port got<br>
chosen. Resolves another part of ticket 3076.</li>
<li>Add a new ControlSocketsGroupWritable configuration option: when<br>
it is turned on, ControlSockets are group-writeable by the default<br>
group of the current user. Patch by Jérémy Bobbio; implements<br>
ticket 2972.</li>
<li>Tor now refuses to create a ControlSocket in a directory that is<br>
world-readable (or group-readable if ControlSocketsGroupWritable<br>
is 0). This is necessary because some operating systems do not<br>
enforce permissions on an AF_UNIX sockets. Permissions on the<br>
directory holding the socket, however, seems to work everywhere.</li>
<li>Rate-limit a warning about failures to download v2 networkstatus<br>
documents. Resolves part of bug 1352.</li>
<li>Backport code from 0.2.3.x that allows directory authorities to<br>
clean their microdescriptor caches. Needed to resolve bug 2230.</li>
<li>When an HTTPS proxy reports &quot;403 Forbidden&quot;, we now explain<br>
what it means rather than calling it an unexpected status code.<br>
Closes bug 2503. Patch from Michael Yakubovich.</li>
<li>Update to the May 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Authorities now clean their microdesc cache periodically and when<br>
reading from disk initially, not only when adding new descriptors.<br>
This prevents a bug where we could lose microdescriptors. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.2.6-alpha. 2230</li>
<li>Do not crash when our configuration file becomes unreadable, for<br>
example due to a permissions change, between when we start up<br>
and when a controller calls SAVECONF. Fixes bug 3135; bugfix<br>
on 0.0.9pre6.</li>
<li>Avoid a bug that would keep us from replacing a microdescriptor<br>
cache on Windows. (We would try to replace the file while still<br>
holding it open. That&#39;s fine on Unix, but Windows doesn&#39;t let us<br>
do that.) Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; bug found by wanoskarnet.</li>
<li>Add missing explanations for the authority-related torrc options<br>
RephistTrackTime, BridgePassword, and V3AuthUseLegacyKey in the<br>
man page. Resolves issue 2379.</li>
<li>As an authority, do not upload our own vote or signature set to<br>
ourself. It would tell us nothing new, and as of 0.2.2.24-alpha,<br>
it would get flagged as a duplicate. Resolves bug 3026.</li>
<li>Accept hidden service descriptors if we think we might be a hidden<br>
service directory, regardless of what our consensus says. This<br>
helps robustness, since clients and hidden services can sometimes<br>
have a more up-to-date view of the network consensus than we do,<br>
and if they think that the directory authorities list us a HSDir,<br>
we might actually be one. Related to bug 2732; bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
<li>When a controller changes TrackHostExits, remove mappings for<br>
hosts that should no longer have their exits tracked. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.0.1-rc.</li>
<li>When a controller changes VirtualAddrNetwork, remove any mappings<br>
for hosts that were automapped to the old network. Bugfix on<br>
0.1.1.19-rc.</li>
<li>When a controller changes one of the AutomapHosts* options, remove<br>
any mappings for hosts that should no longer be automapped. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>
<li>Do not reset the bridge descriptor download status every time we<br>
re-parse our configuration or get a configuration change. Fixes<br>
bug 3019; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (code cleanup):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When loading the microdesc journal, remember its current size.<br>
In 0.2.2, this helps prevent the microdesc journal from growing<br>
without limit on authorities (who are the only ones to use it in<br>
0.2.2). Fixes a part of bug 2230; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.<br>
Fix posted by &quot;cypherpunks.&quot;</li>
<li>The microdesc journal is supposed to get rebuilt only if it is<br>
at least _half_ the length of the store, not _twice_ the length<br>
of the store. Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; fixes part of bug 2230.</li>
<li>Fix a potential null-pointer dereference while computing a<br>
consensus. Bugfix on tor-0.2.0.3-alpha, found with the help of<br>
clang&#39;s analyzer.</li>
<li>Avoid a possible null-pointer dereference when rebuilding the mdesc<br>
cache without actually having any descriptors to cache. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.2.6-alpha. Issue discovered using clang&#39;s static analyzer.</li>
<li>If we fail to compute the identity digest of a v3 legacy keypair,<br>
warn, and don&#39;t use a buffer-full of junk instead. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.1-alpha; fixes bug 3106.</li>
<li>Resolve an untriggerable issue in smartlist_string_num_isin(),<br>
where if the function had ever in the future been used to check<br>
for the presence of a too-large number, it would have given an<br>
incorrect result. (Fortunately, we only used it for 16-bit<br>
values.) Fixes bug 3175; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>
<li>Require that introduction point keys and onion handshake keys<br>
have a public exponent of 65537. Starts to fix bug 3207; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Removed features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Caches no longer download and serve v2 networkstatus documents<br>
unless FetchV2Networkstatus flag is set: these documents haven&#39;t<br>
haven&#39;t been used by clients or relays since 0.2.0.x. Resolves<br>
bug 3022.</li>
</ul>
