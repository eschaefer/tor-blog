          <h2>CIMA/NED Panel on Iran and New Media</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Jul 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>I was invited to join a panel discussion on Iran and New Media hosted by the Center for International Media Assistance and the National Endowment for Democracy. The full 90 minute video is now online; as is my presentation.</p>

<p>The general overview of the panel is <a href="http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html" title="http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html">http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html</a></p>

<p>A number of press people talked to me afterwards, including Al-Jazeera. There were reporters from Xinhua and China Daily in the audience as well. These reporters paid close attention to anything I said about China.</p>

<p>I spoke about what I knew and generally tried to avoid starting international incidents. A few of my answers to questions rambled a bit.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great panel and I learned more about what goes on inside Iran from the different panelists.</p>
