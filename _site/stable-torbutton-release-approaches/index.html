          <h2>Stable Torbutton Release Approaches</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Jul 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For those of you just tuning in: Over the past year, I have been the maintainer of the <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/">Torbutton Firefox extension</a>, adding a number of features and security enhancements to transform Torbutton from a simple proxy switcher into a secure way to <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/design/#requirements">fully isolate all browser state</a> from one proxy state to another and defend against all known <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/design/#adversary">privacy and IP address leakage attacks</a>.</p>

<p>The release candidate phase of the extension started about a month ago, but with the release of Firefox 3 and Torbutton 1.2.0rc series occurring at the same time, we&#39;ve hit a number of unexpected rough spots and snags. However, with the 1.2.0rc5 release of Torbutton, I&#39;m pleased to report that the majority of those now seem to be <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG">behind us</a> (a few annoying <a href="https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/design/#FirefoxBugs">Firefox bugs</a> notwithstanding).</p>

<p>Thanks to contributions from <a href="http://www.fdn.fr/%7Earenevier/">arno</a>, the Cookie Jar features now work with Firefox 3. They have even been improved to allow cookies to persist in memory-based jars across Tor toggle (as opposed to requiring Tor cookies to be written to disk to preserve them), which I personally already find very useful.</p>

<p>In addition, Torbutton is now much better about preserving users&#39; custom Firefox preferences, including password and form fill preferences. Amusingly, the fact that we touch these preferences to protect users during Tor usage led to wild speculation on the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275">addons.mozilla.org page</a> that we were using them to steal passwords and send user details to Alexa. Of course, simply grepping the <a href="https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/torbutton/trunk">source code</a> for &#39;Alexa&#39; and related IP addresses proves this to be false, but that didn&#39;t stop at least three people (or at least three sock puppets) from running with the rumor that Torbutton is a password stealer. Ignorance sure is contagious.</p>

<p>At any rate, after over a year since development began, it looks like we&#39;re finally getting really close to declaring Torbutton 1.2.0 &#39;stable&#39;, which should coincide nicely with the upcoming Tor 0.2.0 stable release and bundles. It&#39;s been a long road!</p>
