<div class="event">
<p>We&#39;ve published our <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf">three-year development roadmap</a>. There are two main goals in publishing this document: first to be more transparent in what we&#39;re doing; and second to ask for help in improving everything related to Tor.</p>

<p>While we don&#39;t expect everyone will read through the roadmap start to finish, the Table of Contents provides a quick overview of the high-level goals. Each high-level goal is fairly independent of another, so you can simply read about the goals that interest you.</p>

<p>And for the first time ever, we&#39;ve created a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release.html.en">press release</a>. This is our attempt to become more press friendly and provide a way for the media to start a conversation with us.</p>

<p>We welcome your comments and feedback!</p>
