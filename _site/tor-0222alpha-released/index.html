          <h2>Tor 0.2.2.2-alpha released</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>On September 21st, we released Tor version 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tor now tracks how long it takes to build client-side circuits<br>
over time, and adapts its timeout to local network performance.<br>
Since a circuit that takes a long time to build will also provide<br>
bad performance, we get significant latency improvements by<br>
discarding the slowest 20% of circuits. Specifically, Tor creates<br>
circuits more aggressively than usual until it has enough data<br>
points for a good timeout estimate. Implements proposal 151.<br>
We are especially looking for reports (good and bad) from users with<br>
both EDGE and broadband connections that can move from broadband<br>
to EDGE and find out if the build-time data in the .tor/state gets<br>
reset without loss of Tor usability. You should also see a notice<br>
log message telling you that Tor has reset its timeout.</li>
<li>Directory authorities can now vote on arbitary integer values as<br>
part of the consensus process. This is designed to help set<br>
network-wide parameters. Implements proposal 167.</li>
<li>Tor now reads the &quot;circwindow&quot; parameter out of the consensus,<br>
and uses that value for its circuit package window rather than the<br>
default of 1000 cells. Begins the implementation of proposal 168.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a remotely triggerable memory leak when a consensus document<br>
contains more than one signature from the same voter. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix an extremely rare infinite recursion bug that could occur if<br>
we tried to log a message after shutting down the log subsystem.<br>
Found by Matt Edman. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix parsing for memory or time units given without a space between<br>
the number and the unit. Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1076.</li>
<li>A networkstatus vote must contain exactly one signature. Spec<br>
conformance issue. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>
<li>Fix an obscure bug where hidden services on 64-bit big-endian<br>
systems might mis-read the timestamp in v3 introduce cells, and<br>
refuse to connect back to the client. Discovered by &quot;rotor&quot;.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>We were triggering a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever<br>
we connect via the v2 connection protocol to any relay that has<br>
a wrong clock. Instead, we should only inform the controller when<br>
it&#39;s a trusted authority that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.20-rc; starts to fix bug 1074. Reported by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>We were telling the controller about CHECKING_REACHABILITY and<br>
REACHABILITY_FAILED status events whenever we launch a testing<br>
circuit or notice that one has failed. Instead, only tell the<br>
controller when we want to inform the user of overall success or<br>
overall failure. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha. Fixes bug 1075. Reported<br>
by SwissTorExit.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn when we&#39;re using a circuit that ends with a node<br>
excluded in ExcludeExitNodes, but the circuit is not used to access<br>
the outside world. This should help fix bug 1090, but more problems<br>
remain. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>
<li>Work around a small memory leak in some versions of OpenSSL that<br>
stopped the memory used by the hostname TLS extension from being<br>
freed.</li>
<li>Make our &#39;torify&#39; script more portable; if we have only one of<br>
&#39;torsocks&#39; or &#39;tsocks&#39; installed, don&#39;t complain to the user;<br>
and explain our warning about tsocks better.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;getinfo status/accepted-server-descriptor&quot; controller<br>
command, which is the recommended way for controllers to learn<br>
whether our server descriptor has been successfully received by at<br>
least on directory authority. Un-recommend good-server-descriptor<br>
getinfo and status events until we have a better design for them.</li>
<li>Update to the &quot;September 4 2009&quot; ip-to-country file.</li>
</ul>
