<p>Perhaps you&#39;ve noticed that the packages for CentOS 4 and OSX Tiger/10.4 haven&#39;t been updated lately. Welcome to dead hard drives.</p>

<p>For a long while, I used <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a> for guest OSes to build the various rpm and windows packages. This mostly worked well. And then both drives in the physical server I used to host the vmware instance failed. A two-drive RAID 1 array doesn&#39;t like it when both drives fail. I replaced the drives, re-installed Debian, and attempted to install vmware server again. The vmware kernel module refused to load. I tried the old tricks to get it to work, nothing. I finally looked at some script/patch that I found via Google, and got the module to load. Then my license key didn&#39;t work anymore.</p>

<p>In frustration, I gave up and installed <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. CentOS 4 defaults to using an SMP kernel on install, which Virtualbox (aka qemu) doesn&#39;t like at all. CentOS 4 installs just fine, it just won&#39;t boot after install. I haven&#39;t had time to further fix the problem. For the time being, there&#39;s no CentOS 4 (Redhat 4 rpms) for Tor.</p>

<p>As for OSX, well, there was no raid array of any kind, just a single drive in a mac mini. It died in a fit of 0xE0030005 (Undefined) errors and now won&#39;t boot at all. A new drive is on the way. I expect to have OSX Tiger/10.4 packages in a week or so. The good news is that the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/stats/imac_se_dv_400.html">Panther Mac</a> continues to work just fine.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s time to start using Amazon&#39;s EC2 or something similar instead of messing with all this hardware and virtualization software. Or maybe I should work on hacking OSX 10.4 and 10.5 into virtualbox.</p>

<p>** Update 2008-08-06: new drive was DOA. And it appears the logic board on the mac mini is fried. Ugh.</p>
