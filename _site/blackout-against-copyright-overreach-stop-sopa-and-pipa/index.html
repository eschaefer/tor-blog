          <h2>Blackout Against Copyright Overreach: Stop SOPA and PIPA</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Jan 2012</p>

<div class="event">
<p>The Tor Project doesn&#39;t usually get involved with U.S. copyright debates. But SOPA and PIPA (the House&#39;s &quot;Stop Online Piracy Act&quot; and the Senate&#39;s &quot;Protect-IP Act&quot;) go beyond enforcement of copyright. These copyright bills would strain the infrastructure of the Internet, on which many free communications -- anonymous or identified -- depend. Originally, the bills proposed that so-called &quot;rogue sites&quot; should be blocked through the Internet&#39;s Domain Name System (DNS). That would have broken DNSSEC security and shared U.S. censorship tactics with those of China&#39;s &quot;great firewall.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, while we hear that DNS-blocking is off the table, the bills remain threatening to the network of intermediaries who carry online speech. Most critically to Tor, SOPA contained a provision forbidding &quot;circumvention&quot; of court-ordered blocking that was written broadly enough that it <a href="http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2011/12/15/stopping-sopas-anti-circumvention.html">could apply to Tor</a> -- which helps its users to &quot;circumvent&quot; local-network censorship. Further, both bills broaden the reach of intermediary liability, to hold conduits and search engines liable for user-supplied infringement. The private rights of action and &quot;safe harbors&quot; could force or encourage providers to censor well beyond the current DMCA&#39;s &quot;notice and takedown&quot; provision (of which <a href="https://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a> documents numerous burdens and abuses).</p>

<p>On January 18, we&#39;re joining <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/01/16/wikipedias-community-calls-for-anti-sopa-blackout-january-18/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html">Reddit</a>, the <a href="http://blog.media.mit.edu/2012/01/media-lab-is-against-sopa-and-pipa.html">MIT Media Lab</a>, and <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">hundreds of others</a> in protest, turning a portion of the Tor site black to call attention to copyright balance and remind the US Congress and voters of the value of the open Internet.</p>

<p>U.S. citizens, please call or write, to <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">urge your representatives to stop SOPA and PIPA</a>. Elsewhere in the world, keep an eye out for similar legislation. and bring the fight there too.</p>
