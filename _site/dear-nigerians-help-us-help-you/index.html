<p>You&#39;ve flooded the blog and tor-assistants with lots of cries for help about Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, and a slew of VPNs all being blocked. Sometimes this is through MTN Nigera, sometimes not.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG" title="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG">http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG</a> suggests access is a 50/50 chance for some sites.</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Iins...</a>. That FAQ entry is a fine place to start. Telling us Tor doesn&#39;t work lets us know there is a problem. Sending in logs from Message Log would be a great start. We need to know what Tor records while trying to connect to the Tor Network.</p>

<p>Someone could further startup Wireshark and record the entire session of Tor starting up and ultimately failing to connect to the Tor Network.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways ISPs in Nigeria can block Tor and your favorite websites. DNS filtering, IP blacklisting, proxy server keyword filtering, govt mandated blackbox firewalls/proxy servers, or just simply blocking the published tor relays list. The worst case is Nigeria white lists the Internet, allowing you to only visit approved sites (and probably man-in-the-middled as well).</p>

<p>All we know right now is that some ISPs in Nigeria seem to be blocking many websites, tools, and Tor. More data is needed to figure out some solutions.</p>

<p>Updates 2010-07-01: Two people have given us some data from <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1645">MTN</a> and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1625">Etisalat</a> ISPs. It seems these two ISPs have implemented some general &quot;circumvention tool&quot; blocking.</p>
