        <p><p>Welcome to the thirty-fourth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Orfox: a new Firefox-based secure browser for Android</h1>

<p>With the growing popularity of pocket computers (also known as “phones”), users need to have access to censorship-circumvention and anonymity systems on these devices as well as on their desktop or laptop machines. While there is currently no supported implementation of Tor for Apple’s iOS, the <a href="https://guardianproject.info">Guardian Project</a> works closely with the Tor Project to produce (amongst other software) a Tor client for Android named <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">Orbot</a>. Mobile applications can be proxied through Orbot just as they can through the Tor client on other operating systems, but mobile web browsing potentially suffers from the same issues that the Tor Browser was designed to protect against, such as disk leaks and a large attack surface. The Guardian Project has therefore also been maintaining a dedicated mobile browser for use with Orbot under the name <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb/">Orweb</a>.</p>

<p>Orweb is based on WebView, and is limited by that browser’s features; flaws such as the <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/30/recent-news-on-orweb-flaws/">potential HTML5 IP leak</a>, while possible to work around in the short term, have made it clear that the best future for secure mobile browsing lies in a switch to an application based on Firefox/Fennec/GeckoView.</p>

<p>Following a successful Google Summer of Code project by <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007379.html">Amogh Pradeep</a> and work by other Guardian Project members, Nathan Freitas <a href="https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-August/003717.html">announced</a> that “a real working version” of Orfox, the new Orbot-compatible mobile browser, is now available. “All the necessary defaults [have been] changed to match Tor Browser’s defaults as closely as possible”; the developers also “remove the Android permissions for things like camera, mic, GPS” and “turn off webrtc.”</p>

<p>“We still need to figure out which preferences and features map between the desktop mobile browser and the Android version, so there is quite a bit of work to do”, but you can download and test this initial version by following the links in Nathan’s email. “Over the next few months we hope to launch this as our new official browser for Orbot, and deprecate Orweb as quickly as possible”, he concluded.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>A new release of ooniprobe, the network interference data collector for <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI</a>, was <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-August/000147.html">announced</a> by Arturo Filastò. Version 1.1.0 introduces a new command line tool “for listing the reports that have not been published to a collector and that allows the probe operator to choose which ones they would like to upload”. The new version also improves the privacy of the reports by sanitizing file paths.</p>

<p>Developers of applications using <a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo</a> — the web service to learn about currently running Tor relays and bridges — are invited to join the new <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/onionoo-announce">onionoo-announce mailing list</a>. Keeping the list low volume, Karsten Loesing plans on using it to announce major protocol changes, scheduled maintenance, major bug fixes, and other important news.</p>

<p>Yawning Angel has <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007404.html">made available</a> an experimental version of the Tor Browser that includes the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4">obfs4</a> pluggable transport. Testing on Windows and OS X would be particularly welcome.</p>

<p>Fabian Keil <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007412.html">reported</a> that FreeBSD now includes ports of liballium and obfsclient.</p>

<p>JusticeRage <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005168.html">explained</a> how relay operators who offer exiting on port 25 can protect the reputation of their domain name by using the Sender Policy Framework.</p>

<p>Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi sent the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007399.html">final GSoC report</a> for the Tor Weather rewrite project. Juha Nurmi sent <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000625.html">another report</a> on the development of ahmia.fi.</p>

<p>Thanks to s7r for hosting a new <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000669.html">mirror</a> of the Tor Project’s website and software!</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>Users of different VPN (Virtual Private Network) services have told the help desk that Tor Browser has difficulty connecting to Tor when a VPN is in use. Using Tor with a VPN is not supported. For a trusted entry into the Tor network, bridges and pluggable transports are recommended, while for anonymizing all network traffic coming from a computer, <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> is recommended.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>The bandwidth authority scanners measure the actual bandwidth offered by Tor relays in order to get accurate information into the Tor consensus. The measurement process currently splits up the set of relays that are to be measured into 4 subsets, with the goal that measuring each of these subsets should take <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/3440">about the same time</a>. However, this is not the case. Measuring subsets 2 and 3 is about twice as fast as measuring subset 1, and subset 4 is twice as fast as subset 2 and 3. If you&#39;re up for doing some experiments to split up the set into more equal subsets, please let us know about your findings on the ticket.</p>

        <p><p>Welcome to the thirty-third issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the community around Tor, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/aphex-twin-deep-web-album-syro/">Aphex Twin’s favorite anonymity network</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.4 and 4.0-alpha-1 are out</h1>

<p>Erinn Clark took to the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-364-and-40-alpha-1-are-released">Tor Blog</a> to announce two new releases by the Tor Browser team. The stable version (3.6.4) contains fixes for several new OpenSSL bugs, although since Tor should only be vulnerable to one of them, and “as this issue is only a DoS”, it is not considered a critical security update. This release also brings Tor Browser users the fixes that give log warnings about the RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack explained <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">last month</a>. Please be sure to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Alongside this stable release, the first alpha version of Tor Browser 4.0 is now available. Among the most exciting new features of this series is the inclusion of the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> pluggable transport. In contrast to the bridge-based transports already available in Tor Browser, meek relies on a principle of “too big to block”, as its creator David Fifield <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport#comment-70044">explained</a>: “instead of going through a bridge with a secret address, you go through a known domain ( <a href="http://www.google.com" title="www.google.com">www.google.com</a> for example) that the censor will be reluctant to block. You don’t need to look up any bridge addresses before you get started”. meek currently supports two “front domains”, Google and Amazon Web Services; it may therefore be especially useful for users behind extremely restrictive national or local firewalls. David posted a fuller explanation of meek, and how to configure it, in a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport">separate blog post</a>.</p>

<p>This alpha release also “paves the way to [the] upcoming autoupdater by reorganizing the directory structure of the browser”, as Erinn wrote. This means that users upgrading from any previous Tor Browser series cannot extract the new version over their existing Tor Browser folder, or it will not work.</p>

<p>You can consult the full list of changes and bugfixes for both versions in Erinn’s post, and download the new releases themselves from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">Tor website</a>.</p>

<h1>The Tor network no longer supports designating relays by name</h1>

<p>Since the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/161d7d1:/src/config/torrc.in#l20">very first versions of Tor</a>, relay operators have been able to specify “nicknames” for their relays. Such nicknames were initially meant to be unique across the network, and operators of directory authorities would manually “bind” a relay identity key after verifying the nickname. The process became formalized with the “Named” flag introduced in the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/attic/dir-spec-v2.txt#l427">0.1.1 series</a>, and later automated with the 0.2.0 series. If a relay held a unique nickname for long enough, the authoritywould recognize the binding, and subsequently reserve the name for half a year.</p>

<p>Nicknames are useful because it appears humans are not very good at thinking using long strings of random bits. Initially, they made it possible to understand what was happening in the network more easily, and to designate a specific relay in an abbreviated way. Having two relays in the network with the same nickname is not really problematic when one is looking at nodes, or a list in <a href="https://globe.torproject.org/#/search/query=Unnamed">Globe</a>, as relays can always be differentiated by their IP addresses or identity keys.</p>

<p>But complications arise when nicknames are used to specify one relay to the exclusion of another. If the wrong relay gets selected, it can become a security risk. Even though <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/122-unnamed-flag.txt">real efforts</a> have been made to improve the situation, properly enforcing uniqueness has always been problematic, and a burden for the few directory authorities that handle naming.</p>

<p>Back in April, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160">“Heartbleed” bug</a> forced many relays to switch to a new identity key, thus losing their “Named” flag. Because this meant that anyone designating relays by their nickname would now have a hard time continuing to do so, Sebastian Hahn decided to use the opportunity to <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/235-kill-named-flag.txt">get rid of the idea entirely</a>.</p>

<p>This week, Sebastian <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007348.html">wrote</a>: “Code review down to 0.2.3.x has shown that the naming-related code hasn’t changed much at all, and no issues were found which would mean a Named-flag free consensus would cause any problems. gabelmoo and tor26 have stopped acting as Naming Directory Authorities, and — pending any issues — will stay that way.”</p>

<p>This means that although you can still give your relay a nickname in its configuration file, designating relays by nickname for any other purpose (such as telling Tor to avoid using certain nodes) has now stopped working. “If you — in your Tor configuration file — refer to any relay by name and not by identity hash, please change that immediately. Future versions of Tor will not support using names in the configuration at all”, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-August/034380.html">warns Sebastian</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>meejah <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007375.html">announced</a> the release of version 0.11.0 of txtorcon, a Twisted-based Python controller library for Tor. This release brings several API improvements; see meejah’s message for full release notes and instructions on how to download it.</p>

<p>Mike Perry posted an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isec-partners-conducts-tor-browser-hardening-study">overview</a> of a recent report put together by iSEC Partners and commissioned by the Open Technology Fund to explore “current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser”. Among other things, Mike’s post addresses the report’s immediate hardening recommendations, latest thoughts on the proposed Tor Browser “security slider”, and longer-term security development measures, as well as ways in which the development of Google Chrome could inform Tor Browser’s own security engineering.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson asked for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007355.html">comments</a> on Trunnel, “a little tool to automatically generate binary encoding and parsing code based on C-like structure descriptions” intended to prevent “Heartbleed”-style vulnerabilities from creeping into Tor’s binary-parsing code in C. “My open questions are: Is this a good idea? Is it a good idea to use this in Tor? Are there any tricky bugs left in the generated code? What am I forgetting to think of?”, wrote Nick.</p>

<p>George Kadianakis followed up his <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007042.html">journey to the core</a> of what Tor does when trying to connect to entry guards in the absence of a network connection with <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007346.html">another post</a> running through some possible improvements to Tor’s behavior in these situations: “I’m looking forward to some feedback on the proposed algorithms as well as improvements and suggestions”.</p>

<p>Arturo Filastò <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007353.html">requested feedback</a> on some proposed changes to the format of the “test deck” used by ooni-probe, the main project of the Open Observatory of Network Interference. “A test deck is basically a way of telling it ‘Run this list of OONI tests with these inputs and by the way be sure you also set these options properly when doing so’…This new format is supposed to overcome some of the limitations of the old design and we hope that a major redesign will not be needed in the near future”, wrote Arturo.</p>

<p>Tor’s importance to users who are at risk, for a variety of reasons, makes it an attractive target for creators of malware, who distribute fake or modified versions of Tor software for malicious purposes. Following a recent report of a fake Tor Browser in circulation, Julien Voisin carried out an investigation of the compromised software, and posted a <a href="http://dustri.org/b/torbundlebrowserorg.html">detailed analysis</a> of the results. To ensure you are protected against this sort of attack, make sure you <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures">verify</a> any Tor software you download before running it!</p>

<p>Arlo Breault submitted a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000622.html">status report for July</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>The help desk has been asked if it is possible to set up an anonymous blog using Tor. The <a href="https://github.com/kloesing/hyde/blob/master/publisher-manual/index.md">Hyde project</a>, developed by Karsten Loesing, documents the step-by-step process of using Tor, Jekyll, and Nginx to host an anonymous blog as a hidden service.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>The Tor StackExchange site is looking for another <a href="https://meta.tor.stackexchange.com/q/207/88">friendly and helpful moderator</a>.

        <p><p>In May, the <a href="https://www.opentechfund.org/">Open Technology Fund</a> commissioned <a href="https://www.isecpartners.com/">iSEC Partners</a> to study current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser. The Open Technology Fund is the primary funder of Tor Browser development, and it commissions security analysis and review for all of the projects that it funds as a standard practice. We worked with iSEC to define the scope of the engagement to focus on the following six main areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review of the current state of hardening in Tor Browser</li>
<li>Investigate additional hardening options and instrumentation</li>
<li>Perform historical vulnerability analysis on Firefox, in order to make informed vulnerability surface reduction recommendations</li>
<li>Investigate image, audio, and video codecs and their respective library&#39;s vulnerability history</li>
<li>Review our current about:config settings, both for vulnerability surface reduction and security</li>
<li>Review alternate/obscure protocol and application handlers</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/tree/master/reports/Tor%20Browser%20Bundle">complete report</a> is available in the iSEC publications github repo. All tickets related to the report can be found using the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=%7Etbb-isec-report">tbb-isec-report keyword</a>. General Tor Browser security tickets can be found using the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=%7Etbb-security">tbb-security keyword</a>.</p>

<h1>Major Findings and Recommendations</h1>

<p>The report had the following high-level findings and recommendations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Address Space Layout Randomization is disabled on Windows and Mac</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Due to our use of cross-compilation and non-standard toolchains in <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">our reproducible build system</a>, several hardening features have ended up disabled. We have known about the Windows issues prior to this report, and should have a fix for them soon. However, the MacOS issues are news to us, and appear to require that we build 64 bit versions of the Tor Browser for full support. The parent ticket for all basic hardening issues in Tor Browser is <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10065">bug #10065</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Participate in Pwn2Own</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>iSEC recommended that we find a sponsor to fund a <a href="http://www.pwn2own.com/">Pwn2Own</a> reward for bugs specific to Tor Browser in a semi-hardened configuration. We are very interested in this idea and would love to talk with anyone willing to sponsor us in this competition, but we&#39;re not yet certain that our hardening options will have stabilized with enough lead time for the 2015 contest next March.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Test and recommend the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit on Windows</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544">Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit</a> is an optional toolkit that Windows users can run to further harden Tor Browser against exploitation. We&#39;ve created <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12820">bug #12820</a> for this analysis.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replace the Firefox memory allocator (jemalloc) with ctmalloc/PartitionAlloc</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>PartitionAlloc is a memory allocator designed by Google specifically to mitigate common heap-based vulnerabilities by hardening free lists, creating partitioned allocation regions, and using guard pages to protect metadata and partitions. Its basic hardening features can be picked up by using it as a simple malloc replacement library (as ctmalloc). <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10281">Bug #10281</a> tracks this work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make use of advanced ParitionAlloc features and other instrumentation to reduce the risk from use-after-free vulnerabilities</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The iSEC vulnerability review found that the overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities to date in Firefox were use-after-free, followed closely by general heap corruption. In order to mitigate these vulnerabilities, we would need to make use of the heap partitioning features of PartitionAlloc to actually ensure that allocations are partitioned (for example, by using the existing tags from Firefox&#39;s <a href="about:memory">about:memory</a>). We will also investigate enabling assertions in limited areas of the codebase, such as the refcounting system, the JIT and the Javascript engine.</p>

<h1>Vulnerability Surface Reduction (Security Slider)</h1>

<p>A large portion of the report was also focused on analyzing historical Firefox vulnerability data and other sources of large vulnerability surface for a planned &quot;Security Slider&quot; UI in Tor Browser.</p>

<p>The Security Slider was first suggested by Roger Dingledine as a way to make it easy for users to trade off between functionality and security, gradually disabling features ranked by both vulnerability count and web prevalence/usability impact.</p>

<p>The report makes several recommendations along these lines, but a brief distillation can be found on the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387#comment:43">ticket for the slider</a>.</p>

<p>At a high level, we plan for four levels in this slider. &quot;Low&quot; security will be the current Tor Browser settings, with the addition of JIT support. &quot;Medium-Low&quot; will disable most of the JIT, and make HTML5 media click-to-play via NoScript. &quot;Medium-High&quot; will disable the rest of the JIT, will disable JS on non-HTTPS url bar origins, and disable SVG. &quot;High&quot; will fully disable Javascript, block remote fonts via NoScript, and disable all media codecs except for WebM (which will remain click-to-play).</p>

<h1>The Long Term</h1>

<p>A web browser is a very large and complicated piece of software, and while we believe that the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">privacy properties</a> of Tor Browser are better than those of every other web browser currently available, it is very important to us that we raise the bar to successful code execution and exploitation of Tor Browser as well.</p>

<p>We are very eager to see the deployment of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox">sandboxing support in Firefox</a>, which should go a long way to improving the security of Tor Browser as well. To improve security for their users, Mozilla has recently shifted <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mozilla.dev.platform/e10s/mozilla.dev.platform/q0Ku_8j26Pc/OtHXnNThv0IJ">10 engineers</a> into the Electrolysis project, which provides the groundwork for producing a multiprocess sandbox architecture for the desktop Firefox. This will allow them to provide a Google Chrome style security sandbox for website content, to reduce the risk from software vulnerabilities, and generally impede exploitability.</p>

<p>Until that time, we will also be investigating providing <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10599">hardened builds of Tor Browser</a> using the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/vtv">Virtual Table Verification</a> features of newer GCC releases. While this will not eliminate all vectors of memory corruption-based exploitation (in particular, the hardening properties of AddressSanitizer are not as good as those provided by <a href="www.github.com/santoshn/softboundcets-34/">SoftBounds+CETS</a> for example, but that compiler is not yet production-ready), it should raise the bar to exploitation. We are hopeful that these builds in combination with PartitionAlloc and the Security Slider will satisfy the needs of our users who require high security and who are willing to trade performance and usability in order to get it.</p>

<p>We also hope to include optional <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5791">application-wide sandboxes</a> for Tor Browser as part of the official distribution.</p>

<h1>Why not Google Chrome?</h1>

<p>It is no secret that in many ways, both we and Mozilla are playing catch-up to reach the level of code execution security provided by Google Chrome, and in fact closely following the Google Chrome security team was one of the recommendations of the iSEC report.</p>

<p>In particular, Google Chrome benefits from a <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/guts">multiprocess sandboxing architecture</a>, as well as several further <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet">hardening options and innovations</a> (such as PartitionAlloc).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our budget for the browser project is still very constrained compared to the amount of work that is required to provide the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">privacy properties we feel are important</a>, and Firefox remains a far more cost-effective platform for us for several reasons. In particular, Firefox&#39;s flexible extension system, fully scriptable UI, solid proxy support, and its long Extended Support Release cycle all allow us to accomplish far more with fewer resources than we could with any other web browser.</p>

<p>Further, Google Chrome is far less amenable to supporting <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">basic web privacy</a> and Tor-critical features (such as solid proxy support) than Mozilla Firefox. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fingerprinting">Initial efforts</a> to work with the Google Chrome team saw some success in terms of adding APIs that are crucial to addons such as HTTPS-Everywhere, but we ran into several roadblocks when it came to Tor-specific features and changes. In particular, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ImportantGoogleChromeBugs#ProxyBypassBugs">several bugs required for basic proxy-safe Tor support</a> for Google Chrome&#39;s Incognito Mode ended up blocked for various reasons. The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=80722">worst offender</a> on this front is the use of the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI for certificate validation, without any alternative. This bug means that certificate revocation checking and intermediate certificate retrieval happen outside of the browser&#39;s proxy settings, and is subject to alteration by the OEM and/or the enterprise administrator. Worse, beyond the Tor proxy issues, the use of this OS certificate validation API means that the OEM and enterprise also have a simple entry point for installing their own root certificates to enable transparent HTTPS man-in-the-middle, with full browser validation and no user consent or awareness. All of this is not to mention the need for defenses against <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#identifier-linkability">third party tracking</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability">fingerprinting</a> to prevent the linking of Tor activity to non-Tor usage, and which would also be useful for the wider non-Tor userbase.</p>

<p>While we&#39;d love for this situation to change, and are open to working with Google to improve things, at present it means that our only option for Chrome is to maintain an even more invasive fork than our current Firefox patch set, with much less likelihood of a future merge than with Firefox. As a ballpark estimate, maintaining such a fork would require somewhere between 3 and 5 times the engineering staff and infrastructure we currently have at our disposal, in addition to the ramp-up time to port our current feature set over.</p>

<p>Unless either our funding situation or Google&#39;s attitude towards the features we require changes, Mozilla Firefox will remain the best platform for us to demonstrate that it is in fact possible to provide <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/dnt-ws/position-papers/21.pdf">true privacy by design</a> for the web for those who want it. It is very distressing that this means playing catch-up and forcing our users to make usability tradeoffs in exchange for improved browser security, but we will continue to do what we can to improve that situation, both with Mozilla and with our own independent efforts.</p>

      <div class="post-description">
        <p><p>The recently released 4.0-alpha-1 version of Tor Browser includes <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a>, a new <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html">pluggable transport</a> for censorship circumvention. meek tunnels your Tor traffic through HTTPS, and uses a technique called “domain fronting” to hide the fact that you are communicating with a Tor bridge—to the censor it looks like you are talking to some other web site. For more details, see the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Overview">overview</a> and the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports#meek">Child’s Garden of Pluggable Transports</a>.</p>

<p>You only need meek if your Internet connection is censored so that you can’t use ordinary Tor. Even then, you should try other pluggable transports first, because they have less overhead. My recommended order for trying transports is:</p>

<ol>
<li>obfs3</li>
<li>fte</li>
<li>scramblesuit</li>
<li>meek</li>
<li>flashproxy</li>
</ol>

<p>Use meek if other transports don’t work for you, or if you want to help development by testing it. I have been using meek for my day-to-day browsing for a few months now.</p>

<p>All pluggable transports have some overhead. You might find that meek feels slower than ordinary Tor. We’re working on some tickets that will make it faster in the future: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12428" title="Make it possible to have multiple requests and responses in flight">#12428</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12778" title="Put meek HTTP headers on a diet">#12778</a>, <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12857" title="Use streaming downloads">#12857</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, there are two different backends supported. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#AmazonCloudFront">meek-amazon</a> makes it look like you are talking to an Amazon Web Services server (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge), and <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#GoogleAppEngine">meek-google</a> makes it look like you are talking to the Google search page (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge). It is likely that both will work for you. If one of them doesn’t work, try the other.</p>

<p>These instructions and screenshots are for the 4.0-alpha-1 release. If they change in future releases, they will be updated at <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart</a>.</p>

<h1>How to use meek</h1>

<p>First, download a meek-capable version of Tor Browser for your platform and language.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha" title="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html">Verify the signature</a> and run the bundle according to the instructions for <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#macosx">OS X</a>, or <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#linux">GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

<p>On the first screen, where it says <em>Which of the following best describes your situation?</em>, click the <strong>Configure</strong> button.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-0.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Which of the following best describes your situation?” screen with the “Configure” button highlighted."></center></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does this computer need to use a proxy to access the Internet?</em>, say <strong>No</strong> unless you know you need to use a proxy. meek supports using an upstream proxy, but most users don’t need it.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-1.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does this computer need to use a proxy to access the Internet?” screen with “No” selected."></center></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does this computer&#39;s Internet connection go through a firewall that only allows connections to certain ports?</em>, say <strong>No</strong> . As an HTTPS transport, meek only uses web ports, which are allowed by most firewalls.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-2.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does this computer's Internet connection go through a firewall that only allows connections to certain ports?” screen with “No” selected."></center></p>

<p>On the screen that says <em>Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?</em>, say <strong>Yes</strong> . Saying Yes will lead you to the screen for configuring pluggable transports.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-3.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “Does your Internet Service Provider (ISP) block or otherwise censor connections to the Tor Network?” screen with “Yes” selected."></center></p>

<p>On the pluggable transport screen, select <strong>Connect with provided bridges</strong> and choose either <strong>meek-amazon</strong> or <strong>meek-google</strong> from the list. Probably both of them will work for you, so choose whichever feels faster. If one of them doesn’t work, try the other. Then click the <strong>Connect</strong> button.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/4.0-alpha-1-meek-conf-4.png" alt="Tor Network Settings “You may use the provided set of bridges or you may obtain and enter a custom set of bridges.” screen with “meek-google” selected."></center></p>

<p>If it doesn’t work, you can write to the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev">tor-dev mailing list</a>, or to me personally at <a href="mailto:dcf@torproject.org">dcf@torproject.org</a>, or file a <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket?component=meek">new ticket</a>.</p>

        <p><p>Welcome to the thirty-second issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Torsocks 2.0 is now considered stable</h1>

<p><a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torsocks.git/blob/HEAD:/README.md">Torsocks</a> is a wrapper program that will force an application’s network connections to go through the Tor network. David Goulet <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007330.html">released</a> version 2.0.0, blessing the new codebase as stable after <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/004959.html">more than a year of efforts</a>.</p>

<p>David’s original email highlighted several reasons for a complete rewrite of torsocks. Among the issues were maintainability, error handling, thread safety, and a lack of proper compatibility layer for multiple architectures. The new implementation addresses all these issues while staying about the same size as the previous version (4,000 lines of C according to sloccount), and test coverage has been vastly extended.</p>

<p>Torsocks comes in handy when a piece of software does not natively support the use of a SOCKS proxy. In most cases, the new version may be safer, as torsocks will prevent DNS requests and non-torified connections from happening.</p>

<p>Integrators and power users should watch their steps while migrating to the new version. The configuration file format has changed, and some applications might behave differently as more system calls are now restricted.</p>

<h1>Next generation Hidden Services and Introduction Points</h1>

<p>When Tor clients need to connect to a Hidden Service, the first step is to create a circuit to its “Introduction Point”. There, the Tor client serving the Hidden Service will be waiting through another circuit to agree on a “Rendezvous Point” and pursue the communication through circuits connecting to this freshly selected Tor node.</p>

<p>This general design is not subject to any changes in the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt">revision of hidden services</a> currently being worked on. But there are still some questions left unanswered regarding the best way to select Introduction Points. George Kadianakis <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007335.html">summarized</a> them as: “How many IPs should an HS have? Which relays can be IPs? What’s the lifetime of an IP?”</p>

<p>For each of these questions, George collected possible answers and assessed whether or not they could respond to several attacks identified in the past. Anyone interested should help with the research needed and join the discussion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Michael Rogers is also trying to <a href="https://fulpool.org/pipermail/hidden-services/2014-August/000019.html">find ways</a> to improve hidden service performance in mobile contexts. One way to do so would be to “keep the set of introduction points as stable as possible”. However, a naive approach to doing so would ease the job of attackers trying to locate a hidden service. The idea would be to always use the same guard and middle node for a given introduction point, but this might also open the doors to new attacks. Michael suggests experimenting with the recently published <a href="https://github.com/drgowen/tor-research-framework">Java research framework</a> to gain a better understanding of the implications.</p>

<h1>More status reports for July 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of July continued, with submissions from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000615.html">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000616.html">Colin C.</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000617.html">Damian Johnson</a>.</p>

<p>Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000619.html">SponsorF</a>. Arturo Filastò described what the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000621.html">OONI team</a> was up to. The <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_06-07/">Tails team</a> covered their activity for June and July.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Two Tor Browser releases are at QA stage: <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-August/000436.html">4.0-alpha-1</a> including meek and a new directory layout, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-August/000439.html">3.6.4</a> for security fixes.</p>

<p>The recent serious <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">attack against Tor hidden services</a> was also a Sybil attack: a large number of malicious nodes joined the network at once. This led to a renewal of interest in detecting Sybil attacks against the Tor network more quickly. Karsten Loesing published <a href="https://github.com/kloesing/SAD">some code</a> computing similarity metrics, and David Fifield has explored <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/12813">visualizations</a> of the consensus that made the recent attack visible.</p>

<p>Gareth Owen sent out an <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007328.html">update</a> about the Java Tor Research Framework. This prompted a discussion with George Kadianakis and Tim about the best way to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzz testing</a> on Tor. Have a look if you want to comment on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007334.html">Tim’s approaches</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000651.html">Daniel Thill</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project website!</p>

<p>ban <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005073.html">mentioned</a> a new service collecting donations for the Tor network. <a href="https://oniontip.com/">OnionTip</a>, set up by Donncha O’Cearbhaill, will collect bitcoins and redistribute them to relay operators who put a bitcoin address in their contact information. As the redistribution is currently done according to the consensus weight, Sebastian Hahn <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005077.html">warned</a> that this might encourage people to “cheat the consensus weight” because that now means “more money from oniontip”.</p>

<p>Juha Nurmi sent <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000620.html">another update</a> on the ahmia.fi GSoC project.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>arvee wants to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3802/88">redirect some TCP connections through Tor on OS X</a>; <a href="http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/">Redsocks</a> should help to route packets for port 443 over Tor . mirimir explained that given the user&#39;s pf configuration, the setting “SocksPort 8888” was probably missing.</p>

<p>meee asked a question and offered a bounty for an answer: the circuit handshake entry in Tor’s log file contains some numbers, and meee wants to <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3213/88">know what their meaning is</a>: “Circuit handshake stats since last time: 1833867/1833868 TAP, 159257/159257 NTor.”</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p>The bridge distributor <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">BridgeDB</a> usually gives out bridges by responding to user requests via HTTPS and email. A while ago, BridgeDB also gave out bridges to a very small number of people who would then redistribute bridges using their social network. We would like to resume sending bridges to these people, but only if BridgeDB can be <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/9332">made to send them via GnuPG-encrypted emails</a>. If you’d like to dive into the BridgeDB code and add support for GnuPG-encrypted emails, please take a look at the ticket and give it a try.</p>
