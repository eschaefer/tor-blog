          <p>Welcome to the fortieth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Setup ooniprobe in five minutes</h1>

<p>New versions of the <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a> (OONI) tools are out. On October 1st, Arturo Filastò <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-October/000171.html">announced</a> ooniprobe 1.2.0 and oonibackend 1.1.4.</p>

<p>“One of the most interesting new features that are now part of ooniprobe is the ability to generate test decks for the country you are in a way that is much easier than before”, wrote Arturo.</p>

<p>He added: “As a matter of fact to start contributing useful measurements it’s just a matter of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ooniprobe#ooni-in-5-minutes">5 minutes of setup</a>.” So don’t be shy about adding your measurements to the project!</p>

<h1>Monthly status reports for September 2014</h1>

<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of September has begun. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000652.html">Juha Nurmi</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000653.html">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000654.html">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000655.html">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000656.html">Matt Pagan</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000658.html">Lunar</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000659.html">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000660.html">Leiah Jansen</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000661.html">Harmony</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000662.html">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000663.html">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000665.html">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000666.html">Sukhbir Singh</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000669.html">Nicolas Vigier</a> (in addition to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000667.html">July</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000668.html">August</a>), <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000670.html">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000672.html">J. Todaro</a>, and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000673.html">Colin C.</a></p>

<p>Lunar also reported on <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000657.html">Tor help desk</a>, Mike Perry for the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000664.html">Tor Browser team</a>, and Arturo Filastò for <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000671.html">OONI</a>.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Orbot users should rejoice at the news that <a href="https://orwall.org/">orWall</a> 1.0.0 has been <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035040.html">released</a>! orWall will force selected applications through Tor while preventing unauthorized applications to have any network access. “Any feedback from Tor/Orbot users interests me in order to improve orWall. I think the current release is pretty good, but as the main dev I’m maybe not that neutral regarding this statement” joked CJ.</p>

<p>The OONI project has been “developing a test that allows probes in censored countries to test which bridges are blocked and which are not”. George Kadianakis is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007585.html">seeking help</a> to create interesting visualization of the resulting data. He shared a sketch about <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Easn/bridget_vis/countries_pts.jpg">countries and pluggable transports</a> and another one showing <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Easn/bridget_vis/tbb_blocked_timeline.jpg">time before blocks happened</a>.</p>

<p>Nick Mathewson <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007580.html">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git">Trunnel</a> 1.3. Trunnel is a code generator for binary encoders/decoders. Nick adds: “Some code that it has generated has been merged into the Tor master branch for the 0.2.6 release series, though that code is not yet in active use.“</p>

<p>David Fifield sent a <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007576.html">summary</a> of the costs incurred by the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> pluggable transport for the month of September 2014. More details are included in the email, but costs are currently very low: “$3.85 for App Engine, $4.59 for Amazon, $0.00 for Azure”.</p>

<p>Virgil Griffith <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035076.html">shared</a> a yet unpublished tech report on Tor growth. To pick just one finding, the Tor network’s bandwidth has been doubling every 13–14 months so far.</p>

<p>The Knight Foundation is going to <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/brief.html">fund projects</a> for “the future of libraries”. The <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/submissions/the-library-freedom-project-bringing-privacy-education-and-digital-tools-to-local-communities-through-libraries">Library Freedom Project</a> wants to teach “librarians about privacy rights, law, and tech tools to protect patrons from dragnet surveillance”. It’s based on their <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/radical-librarianship-how-nin.html">previous experience</a> promoting Tor and other privacy tools in Massachusetts libraries. Show them support!</p>

<p>The US National Science Foundation is <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035059.html">seeking input</a> to lay out a future Privacy Research Strategy. The deadline being October 17th, Roger Dingledine suggests: “if anybody here has partially written ideas that they want to put together into a submission, please do!”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-October/000713.html">opi</a> for running a new mirror of the Tor Project’s website and software.</p>

<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-backend">oonibackend</a> is used by ooni, the <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a>, to run in the background and perform tasks like discovering addresses of test helpers and performing measurements that require a backend system to talk to. When oonibackend was changed to fix compatibility with Twisted 13.1 it <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/13116">lost its ability to start tor and then drop privileges</a>. Arturo suspects that the correct way of doing this is to place the logic for starting tor inside of preApplication or startService. But from a quick research he suspects that Twisted does not support returning Deferreds in there. He also points to two relevant Twisted tickets ( <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5941">1</a>, <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6813">2</a>). If you have experience with Twisted and want to help debug or even solve this problem, be sure to post your thoughts or patches to the ticket.</p>

        <div class="post-description">
          <p>Over the last years, we learned a lot about how the Great Firewall of China <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors">is</a> <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/">blocking</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5739v1.pdf">Tor</a>. Some questions remained unanswered, however. Roya, Mueen, Jed, and I just published a <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/%7Eroyaen/gfw/">project</a> which seeks to answer some of these open questions. Being curious as we are, we tried to find answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the filtering decentralised (i.e., happening in provinces) or centralised (i.e., happening in Internet exchange points (IXP))?</li>
<li>Are there any temporal patterns in the filtering? Or in other words, are there certain times when people are more likely to be able to connect to Tor?</li>
<li>Similarly, are there any spatial patterns? Are folks in some special regions of China able to connect to Tor while others cannot?</li>
<li>When a computer in China tries to connect to a Tor relay, what part of the TCP handshake is blocked?</li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that some of these questions are quite tricky to answer. For example, to find spatial patterns, we need to be able to measure the connectivity between <em>many</em> Tor relays and <em>many</em> clients in China. However, we are not able to control <em>even a single</em> one of these machines. So how do we proceed from here? As so often, side channels come to the rescue! In particular, we made use of two neat network measurement side channels which are the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5739v1.pdf">hybrid idle scan</a> and the SYN backlog scan. The backlog scan is a new side channel we discovered and discuss in our paper. Equipped with these two powerful techniques, we were able to infer if there is packet loss between relay A and client B even though we cannot control A and B.</p>

<p>You might notice that our measurement techniques are quite different from most other Internet censorship studies which rely on machines inside the censoring country. While our techniques give us a lot more geographical coverage, they come at a price which is flexibility; we are limited to measuring Internet filtering on the IP layer. More sophisticated filtering techniques such as deep packet inspection remain outside our scope.</p>

<p>Now what we did was to measure the connectivity between several dozen Tor relays and computers in China over four weeks which means that we collected plenty of data points, each of which telling us &quot;was A able to talk to B at time T?&quot;. These data points reveal a number of interesting things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It appears that many IP addresses inside the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) are able to connect to at least our Tor relay.</li>
<li>Apart from the CERNET netblock, the filtering seems to be quite effective despite occasional country-wide downtimes.</li>
<li>It seems like the filtering is centralised at the IXP level instead of being decentralised at the provincial level. That makes sense from the censor&#39;s point of view because it is cheap, effective, and easy to control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now what does all of this mean for Tor users? Our results show that China still has a tight grip on its communication infrastructure, especially on the IP and TCP layer. That is why our circumvention efforts mostly focus on the application layer (with <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek">meek</a> being an exception) and pluggable transport protocols such as <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/">ScrambleSuit</a> (which is now part of the experimental version of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha">TorBrowser</a>) and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git">obfs4</a> are specifically designed to thwart the firewall&#39;s <a href="http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/">active probing attacks</a>.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the thirty-ninth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>

<h1>Tor 0.2.4.24 and 0.2.5.8-rc are out</h1>

<p>Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034937.html">announced</a> new releases in both the stable and the alpha branches of the core Tor software. Clients accessing hidden services should experience faster and more robust connections as they will now send the correct rendezvous point address. “They used to send the wrong address, which would still work some of the time because they also sent the identity digest of the rendezvous point, and if the hidden service happened to try connecting to the rendezvous point from a relay that already had a connection open to it, the relay would reuse that connection”. This fix also prevents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a> of the client’s system from being leaked to the hidden service.</p>

<p>The only other changes in these releases are an update of the geoip databases and the location of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034898.html">gabelmoo directory authority</a>. As usual, you can download the source code from the Tor <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.6 and 4.0-alpha-3 are out</h1>

<p>Mike Perry announced two new releases by the Tor Browser team. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-366-released">Tor Browser 3.6.6</a> includes a workaround for the <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/10804">bug</a> that has sometimes been preventing the browser window from opening after an apparently successful connection to the Tor network; it also stops intermediate SSL certificates from being written to disk. In addition to these fixes, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-40-alpha-3-released">Tor Browser 4.0-alpha-3</a> resolves a number of issues to do with the upcoming Tor Browser updater, including the mistaken upgrade of non-English Tor Browsers to the English-language version. As this bug is only fixed in the new release, users upgrading from 4.0-alpha-2 will still experience this issue during the process. Furthermore, “meek transport users will need to restart their browser a second time after upgrade if they use the in-browser updater. We are still trying to get to the bottom of <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/13247">this issue</a>”, wrote Mike.</p>

<p>Both releases also include important Firefox security updates, so all users should upgrade as soon as possible. See Mike’s announcements for full details, and get your copy from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html">project page</a> or the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/">distribution directory</a>.</p>

<h1>Tails 1.1.2 is out</h1>

<p>The second point release in the Tails 1.1.x series was <a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1.2/">put out</a> by the Tails team, “mainly to fix a serious flaw in the Network Security Services (NSS) library used by Firefox and other products that allows attackers to create forged RSA certificates. Before this release, users on a compromised network could be directed to sites using a fraudulent certificate and mistake them for legitimate sites.”</p>

<p>Other packages affected by recently-disclosed security flaws and updated in this version include APT, bash, and GnuPG, so all Tails users should make sure to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a running copy of Tails, you can make use of the incremental upgrades system; otherwise, head to the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/index">download page</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>obfs4 is ready for general deployment: bridge operators needed!</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports">Pluggable transports</a>, the circumvention techniques which allow users to access the Tor network from censored areas by disguising the fact that the Tor protocol is being used, are about to take another step forward with the release of obfs4, and Yawning Angel <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005372.html">sent out</a> a brief discussion of this new protocol.</p>

<p>obfs4 offers a number of developments over the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit protocols, until now the most sophisticated pluggable transports in use on the Tor network. Like ScrambleSuit, obfs4 improves on obfs3 to “ <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs4-spec.txt">provide resilience against active attackers and to disguise flow signatures</a>”, while a safer and more efficient key-exchange process than ScrambleSuit’s should make it impossible for attackers to launch man-in-the-middle attacks based on the client/bridge shared secret.</p>

<p>Like its predecessors in the obfsproxy series, obfs4 is a bridge-based transport, meaning that volunteers are needed to operate relays running an implementation of the new protocol before users can take advantage of it. The current implementation, obfs4proxy, is now available to download either as <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git">source code</a> or as a package from Debian’s <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/obfs4proxy">unstable repositories</a>. Those who want to try browsing over the new protocol can download Yawning’s <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eyawning/volatile/tor-browser-obfs4-20140926/">experimental Tor Browsers</a>, and if you’re willing to run an obfs4 bridge, please see Yawning’s message for all the relevant details — “questions, comments, and bridges appreciated”!</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>

<p>Anthony G. Basile <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034950.html">announced</a> the release of version 20140925 of tor-ramdisk, the micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release includes updates to Tor, BusyBox, OpenSSL, and the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>As part of the current push to better understand hidden services and their use on the Tor network, Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005352.html">asked</a> relay operators who are “comfortable compiling Tor from git” and who “want to help investigate what fraction of Tor network load comes from hidden service use” to check out the new hs-stats git branch. This version “will collect per-thirty-minute statistics about number of circuits and number of cells your relay sees that have to do with exiting, with hidden services, with circuits where you&#39;re not the final hop, and a fourth none-of-the-above category”, which can then be posted to the appropriate <a href="https://bugs.torproject.org/13192">ticket</a> on the bug tracker or sent to Roger directly.</p>

<p>Yawning Angel <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005344.html">sent</a> a “friendly reminder” to ScrambleSuit bridge operators, asking them to upgrade to tor-0.2.5.x if they haven’t already: “If you are running a ScrambleSuit bridge with tor-0.2.4.x, it is useless. Users that happen to be served your ScrambleSuit bridge will not be able to connect, because the password is missing”.</p>

<p>Mike Perry <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005335.html">asked</a> relay operators, particularly those running exit relays, to contribute information about the “hardware, CPU cores, and uplink” of their servers, and how much these cost per month, in order to “put together some estimates on bounds of the current value and cost of the capacity of the Tor network as it is, and use that to generate some rough guestimates on what it would cost to grow it”.</p>

<p>In response to the possible integration of Tor as a “private browsing mode” by a major browser vendor, Andrew Lewman <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007533.html">kicked off</a> a discussion of ways in which the Tor network might be scaled up to accommodate “hundreds of millions” of extra users.</p>

<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>

<p>In Firefox, it is possible to drag a URL from the Navigation Toolbar to the Desktop in order to create a shortcut to a website, and the help desk has been asked why this functionality is disabled in Tor Browser. A Desktop shortcut to a URL, when clicked, would be opened by the operating system’s default browser, not by Tor Browser. Permitting this behavior would open the door to confusion as to whether or not a user was visiting a link over Tor, and would violate the “Proxy Obedience” requirement of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#proxy-obedience">Tor Browser design</a>.</p>

<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>

<p>Tor StackExchange has started its <a href="https://meta.tor.stackexchange.com/q/221/88">site self-evaluation</a> for September 2014. <a href="http://tor.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval">Ten questions</a> were selected and you’re asked to review them. Are they good or is there room for improvement? Please have a look at the questions and rate them.</p>

<p>Jens Kubieziel noted that users mix up the terms <a href="https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4192/88">Tor, Tor Browser and torbrowser-launcher</a>, so he explained each of them to users of the Q&amp;A page.</p>
