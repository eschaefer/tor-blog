          <h2>Tor Project infrastructure updates</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Jan 2010</p>

<div class="event">
<p>You should upgrade to Tor 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7-alpha:<br>
 <a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en</a></p>

<p>In early January we discovered that two of the seven servers that run directory<br>
authorities were compromised (moria1 and gabelmoo), along with<br>
metrics.torproject.org, a new server we&#39;d recently set up to serve<br>
metrics data and graphs. The three servers have since been reinstalled<br>
with service migrated to other servers.</p>

<p>We made fresh identity keys for the two directory authorities, which is<br>
why you need to upgrade.</p>

<p>Moria also hosted our git repository and svn repository. We took the<br>
services offline as soon as we learned of the breach. It appears the<br>
attackers didn&#39;t realize what they broke into -- just that they had<br>
found some servers with lots of bandwidth. The attackers set up some ssh<br>
keys and proceeded to use the three servers for launching other attacks.<br>
We&#39;ve done some preliminary comparisons, and it looks like git and svn<br>
were not touched in any way.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been very lucky the past few years regarding security. It still<br>
seems this breach is unrelated to Tor itself. To be clear, it doesn&#39;t<br>
seem that anyone specifically attacked our servers to get at Tor. It<br>
seems we were attacked for the cpu capacity and bandwidth of the servers,<br>
and the servers just happened to also carry out functions for Tor.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve tried to address the most common questions below.</p>

<p><strong>I read that Tor&#39;s encryption keys were compromised, is this true?</strong></p>

<p>No. The operating systems were compromised, not tor. The tor source, and running Tor Directory Authorities were left untouched. It appears the<br>
attackers didn&#39;t realize what they broke into -- just that they had<br>
found some servers with lots of bandwidth. We&#39;ve generated new Directory Authority keys out of an abundance of caution.</p>

<p><strong>Does this mean someone could have matched users up to their<br>
destinations?</strong></p>

<p>No. By design, Tor requires a majority of directory authorities (four<br>
in this case) to generate a consensus; and like other relays in the<br>
Tor network, directory authorities don&#39;t know enough to match a user<br>
and traffic or destination.</p>

<p><strong>Does this mean somebody could have changed the Tor source?</strong></p>

<p>No, we&#39;ve checked the source. It does mean you should upgrade so your<br>
client knows about all the currently valid directory authorities.</p>

<p>** Does this mean someone could have learned more about Tor than an<br>
ordinary user?**</p>

<p>Since our software and specifications are open, everyone already has<br>
access to almost everything on these machines... except some old bridge<br>
descriptors, which we give out only in small batches as entry points for<br>
blocked clients.</p>

<p><strong>Can I trust Tor&#39;s security?</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve taken steps to fix the weaknesses identified and to harden our<br>
systems further. Tor has a track record of openness and transparency,<br>
with its source code and specifications and also with its operations.<br>
Moreover, we&#39;re disclosing breaches such as this so you can monitor our<br>
status. You shouldn&#39;t assume those who don&#39;t disclose security breaches<br>
never have any!</p>
