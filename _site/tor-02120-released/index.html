          <h2>Tor 0.2.1.20 Released</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Nov 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Tor 0.2.1.20 fixes a crash bug when you&#39;re accessing many hidden services<br>
at once, prepares for more performance improvements, and fixes a bunch<br>
of smaller bugs.</p>

<p>The Windows and OS X bundles also include a more recent Vidalia, and<br>
switch from Privoxy to Polipo.</p>

<p>The OS X installers are now drag and drop. It&#39;s best to un-install<br>
Tor/Vidalia and then install this new bundle, rather than upgrade. If<br>
you want to upgrade, you&#39;ll need to update the paths for Tor and Polipo<br>
in the Vidalia Settings window.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.20 - 2009-10-15<br>
 o Major bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send circuit or stream sendme cells when our window has decreased<br>
by 100 cells, not when it has decreased by 101 cells. Bug uncovered<br>
by Karsten when testing the &quot;reduce circuit window&quot; performance<br>
patch. Bugfix on the 54th commit on Tor -- from July 2002,<br>
before the release of Tor 0.0.0. This is the new winner of the<br>
oldest-bug prize.<br>

<ul>
<li>Fix a remotely triggerable memory leak when a consensus document<br>
contains more than one signature from the same voter. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.3-alpha.<br></li>
<li>Avoid segfault in rare cases when finishing an introduction circuit<br>
as a client and finding out that we don&#39;t have an introduction key<br>
for it. Fixes bug 1073. Reported by Aaron Swartz.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Major features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tor now reads the &quot;circwindow&quot; parameter out of the consensus,<br>
and uses that value for its circuit package window rather than the<br>
default of 1000 cells. Begins the implementation of proposal 168.</li>
</ul>

<p>o New directory authorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up urras (run by Jacob Appelbaum) as the seventh v3 directory<br>
authority.<br>

<ul>
<li>Move moria1 and tonga to alternate IP addresses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Minor bugfixes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a signed/unsigned compile warning in 0.2.1.19.<br>

<ul>
<li>Fix possible segmentation fault on directory authorities. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.14-rc.<br></li>
<li>Fix an extremely rare infinite recursion bug that could occur if<br>
we tried to log a message after shutting down the log subsystem.<br>
Found by Matt Edman. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.<br></li>
<li>Fix an obscure bug where hidden services on 64-bit big-endian<br>
systems might mis-read the timestamp in v3 introduce cells, and<br>
refuse to connect back to the client. Discovered by &quot;rotor&quot;.<br>
Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.<br></li>
<li>We were triggering a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever<br>
we connect via the v2 connection protocol to any relay that has<br>
a wrong clock. Instead, we should only inform the controller when<br>
it&#39;s a trusted authority that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.20-rc; starts to fix bug 1074. Reported by SwissTorExit.<br></li>
<li>We were telling the controller about CHECKING_REACHABILITY and<br>
REACHABILITY_FAILED status events whenever we launch a testing<br>
circuit or notice that one has failed. Instead, only tell the<br>
controller when we want to inform the user of overall success or<br>
overall failure. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha. Fixes bug 1075. Reported<br>
by SwissTorExit.<br></li>
<li>Don&#39;t warn when we&#39;re using a circuit that ends with a node<br>
excluded in ExcludeExitNodes, but the circuit is not used to access<br>
the outside world. This should help fix bug 1090. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.1.6-alpha.<br></li>
<li>Work around a small memory leak in some versions of OpenSSL that<br>
stopped the memory used by the hostname TLS extension from being<br>
freed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>o Minor features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a &quot;getinfo status/accepted-server-descriptor&quot; controller<br>
command, which is the recommended way for controllers to learn<br>
whether our server descriptor has been successfully received by at<br>
least on directory authority. Un-recommend good-server-descriptor<br>
getinfo and status events until we have a better design for them.</li>
</ul>
