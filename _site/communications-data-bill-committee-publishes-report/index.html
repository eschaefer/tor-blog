          <h2>Communications Data Bill Committee publishes report</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="event">
<p>The UK parliamentary committee considering the Draft Communications Data Bill, to which I <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-projects-position-draft-communications-data-bill">gave evidence</a> on behalf of The Tor Project, has now published <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7902.htm">their report</a> ( <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/79.pdf">PDF version</a>). The committee is highly critical of the draft bill, and calls for the government to consult technical experts, industry, law enforcement bodies, public authorities and civil liberties groups before re-drafting the proposed legislation. The committee&#39;s recommendations for this revised bill are summarised in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7911.htm">section 8</a> of the report.</p>

<p>Tor is not explicitly dealt with by the report other than noting that systems that use encryption, including Tor, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7907.htm#a16">will pose a problem (paragraph 99)</a> for proposals to ask communications service providers to record third party&#39;s data traversing their network. The report does however address numerous points which were raised in The Tor Project&#39;s written and oral evidence (and other organisation&#39;s submissions), including the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7907.htm#a14">over-broad powers</a> the bill would hand over, the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7908.htm#a25">sensitivity of “communications data”</a>, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7908.htm#a27">limited oversight</a>, the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7908.htm#a30">challenge of storing sensitive data securely</a>, and the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201213/jtselect/jtdraftcomuni/79/7910.htm#a36">rather dubious cost/benefit justification</a>.</p>

<p>The committee has now completed its duties, and has consequently disbanded. The committee&#39;s report will now be considered by the government and we will be very interested in their response.</p>
