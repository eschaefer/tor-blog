<div class="post">
<p>On Monday the 25th of March, the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London organized a free event where journalists could <a href="http://www.tcij.org/events/2013-03-25/introduction-digital-security">learn more about digital security</a>. I was invited to speak about Tor, other speakers covered OTR, TrueCrypt, GPG, and mobile security.</p>

<p>The attendees were divided into five groups, and each speaker had 20-25 minutes with each group. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy">Pluggable Transports Bundle</a>, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml">short user manual</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2012-TorProject-Annual-Report.pdf">2012 annual report</a>.</p>

<p>I talked a bit about the history of Tor and the Tor Project, discussed a few different threats, mentioned hidden services, listed a few examples of real world use, and helped everyone get the Tor Browser Bundle up and running. I did not have access to a projector or whiteboard, so I did my best to illustrate how Tor works by drawing boxes, arrows, blobs, and stick figures on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>A number of people asked if we had some sort of document or manual explaining all the topics covered at this event. I mentioned <a href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a box</a> and the <a href="http://flossmanuals.net/">FLOSS Manuals</a>, but also pointed out that there is currently no single document available, that I am aware of, which explains all of these topics.</p>

<p>I have previously discussed creating such a document with the <a href="http://www.rorypecktrust.org/">Rory Peck Trust</a>, which is a London based organization that specializes in safety, security and professional development for freelance journalists. I mentioned this again when I met with them the day after the CIJ event, and Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the end result in a few months.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tcij.org/">Centre for Investigative Journalism</a> for hosting the event and inviting me.</p>
