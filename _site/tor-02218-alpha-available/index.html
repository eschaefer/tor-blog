<p>Tor 0.2.2.18-alpha fixes several crash bugs that have been nagging us lately, makes unpublished bridge relays able to detect their IP address, and fixes a wide variety of other bugs to get us much closer to a stable release.</p>

<p>Packages will be appearing over the next few days. The original version of this announcement is at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html">http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2010/msg00082.html</a>.</p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.18-alpha - 2010-11-16<br>
 o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Do even more to reject (and not just ignore) annotations on<br>
 router descriptors received anywhere but from the cache. Previously<br>
 we would ignore such annotations at first, but cache them to disk<br>
 anyway. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.<br>
 - Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer<br>
 freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection<br>
 try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals<br>
 of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125;<br>
 fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.<br>
 - Learn our external IP address when we&#39;re a relay or bridge, even if<br>
 we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,<br>
 where we introduced bridge relays that don&#39;t need to publish to<br>
 be useful. Fixes bug 2050.<br>
 - Maintain separate TLS contexts and certificates for incoming and<br>
 outgoing connections in bridge relays. Previously we would use the<br>
 same TLS contexts and certs for incoming and outgoing connections.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses bug 988.<br>
 - Maintain separate identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS<br>
 contexts in bridge relays. Previously we would use the same<br>
 identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS contexts. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses the other half of bug 988.<br>
 - Avoid an assertion failure when we as an authority receive a<br>
 duplicate upload of a router descriptor that we already have,<br>
 but which we previously considered an obsolete descriptor.<br>
 Fixes another case of bug 1776. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha.<br>
 - Avoid a crash bug triggered by looking at a dangling pointer while<br>
 setting the network status consensus. Found by Robert Ransom.<br>
 Bugfix on 0.2.2.17-alpha. Fixes bug 2097.<br>
 - Fix a logic error where servers that _didn&#39;t_ act as exits would<br>
 try to keep their server lists more aggressively up to date than<br>
 exits, when it was supposed to be the other way around. Bugfix<br>
 on 0.2.2.17-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.1.x and earlier):<br>
 - When we&#39;re trying to guess whether we know our IP address as<br>
 a relay, we would log various ways that we failed to guess<br>
 our address, but never log that we ended up guessing it<br>
 successfully. Now add a log line to help confused and anxious<br>
 relay operators. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1534.<br>
 - Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the<br>
 acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from<br>
 getting locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a<br>
 path (due to a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because<br>
 its OR is not listed yet. It also prevents Tor clients from using an<br>
 OR running in the same instance as an exit (due to a .exit request)<br>
 if the OR does not meet the same requirements expected of an OR<br>
 running elsewhere. Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.<br>
 - Correctly describe errors that occur when generating a TLS object.<br>
 Previously we would attribute them to a failure while generating a<br>
 TLS context. Patch by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc; fixes<br>
 bug 1994.<br>
 - Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on<br>
 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer.<br>
 - Fix warnings that newer versions of autoconf produced during<br>
 ./autogen.sh. These warnings appear to be harmless in our case,<br>
 but they were extremely verbose. Fixes bug 2020.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x):<br>
 - Enable protection of small arrays whenever we build with gcc<br>
 hardening features, not only when also building with warnings<br>
 enabled. Fixes bug 2031; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha. Reported by keb.</p>

<p>o Minor features:<br>
 - Make hidden services work better in private Tor networks by not<br>
 requiring any uptime to join the hidden service descriptor<br>
 DHT. Implements ticket 2088.<br>
 - Rate-limit the &quot;your application is giving Tor only an IP address&quot;<br>
 warning. Addresses bug 2000; bugfix on 0.0.8pre2.<br>
 - When AllowSingleHopExits is set, print a warning to explain to the<br>
 relay operator why most clients are avoiding her relay.<br>
 - Update to the November 1 2010 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</p>

<p>o Code simplifications and refactoring:<br>
 - When we fixed bug 1038 we had to put in a restriction not to send<br>
 RELAY_EARLY cells on rend circuits. This was necessary as long<br>
 as relays using Tor 0.2.1.3-alpha through 0.2.1.18-alpha were<br>
 active. Now remove this obsolete check. Resolves bug 2081.<br>
 - Some options used different conventions for uppercasing of acronyms<br>
 when comparing manpage and source. Fix those in favor of the<br>
 manpage, as it makes sense to capitalize acronyms.<br>
 - Remove the torrc.complete file. It hasn&#39;t been kept up to date<br>
 and users will have better luck checking out the manpage.<br>
 - Remove the obsolete &quot;NoPublish&quot; option; it has been flagged<br>
 as obsolete and has produced a warning since 0.1.1.18-rc.<br>
 - Remove everything related to building the expert bundle for OS X.<br>
 It has confused many users, doesn&#39;t work right on OS X 10.6,<br>
 and is hard to get rid of once installed. Resolves bug 1274.</p>
