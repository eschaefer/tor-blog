<p><strong>New releases, new hires, new funding</strong></p>

<p>On March 9, we released Tor 0.2.1.13-alpha. It includes the following fixes and enhancements:</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes:<br>
 - Correctly update the list of which countries we exclude as exits, when the GeoIP file is loaded or reloaded. Diagnosed by lark. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x and earlier):<br>
 - Automatically detect MacOSX versions earlier than 10.4.0, and<br>
 disable kqueue from inside Tor when running with these versions.<br>
 We previously did this from the startup script, but that was no<br>
 help to people who didn&#39;t use the startup script. Resolves bug 863.<br>
 - When we had picked an exit node for a connection, but marked it as<br>
 &quot;optional&quot;, and it turned out we had no onion key for the exit,<br>
 stop wanting that exit and try again. This situation may not<br>
 be possible now, but will probably become feasible with proposal<br>
 158. Spotted by rovv. Fixes another case of bug 752.<br>
 - Clients no longer cache certificates for authorities they do not<br>
 recognize. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.<br>
 - When we can&#39;t transmit a DNS request due to a network error, retry<br>
 it after a while, and eventually transmit a failing response to<br>
 the RESOLVED cell. Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha.<br>
 - If the controller claimed responsibility for a stream, but that<br>
 stream never finished making its connection, it would live<br>
 forever in circuit_wait state. Now we close it after SocksTimeout<br>
 seconds. Bugfix on 0.1.2.7-alpha; reported by Mike Perry.<br>
 - Drop begin cells to a hidden service if they come from the middle<br>
 of a circuit. Patch from lark.<br>
 - When we erroneously receive two EXTEND cells for the same circuit<br>
 ID on the same connection, drop the second. Patch from lark.<br>
 - Fix a crash that occurs on exit nodes when a nameserver request<br>
 timed out. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; our CLEAR debugging code had<br>
 been suppressing the bug since 0.1.2.10-alpha. Partial fix for<br>
 bug 929.<br>
 - Do not assume that a stack-allocated character array will be<br>
 64-bit aligned on platforms that demand that uint64_t access is<br>
 aligned. Possible fix for bug 604.<br>
 - Parse dates and IPv4 addresses in a locale- and libc-independent<br>
 manner, to avoid platform-dependent behavior on malformed input.<br>
 - Build correctly when configured to build outside the main source<br>
 path. Patch from Michael Gold.<br>
 - We were already rejecting relay begin cells with destination port<br>
 of 0. Now also reject extend cells with destination port or address<br>
 of 0. Suggested by lark.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x):<br>
 - Don&#39;t re-extend introduction circuits if we ran out of RELAY_EARLY<br>
 cells. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha. Fixes more of bug 878.<br>
 - If we&#39;re an exit node, scrub the IP address to which we are exiting<br>
 in the logs. Bugfix on 0.2.1.8-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor features:<br>
 - On Linux, use the prctl call to re-enable core dumps when the user<br>
 is option is set.<br>
 - New controller event NEWCONSENSUS that lists the networkstatus<br>
 lines for every recommended relay. Now controllers like Torflow<br>
 can keep up-to-date on which relays they should be using.<br>
 - Update to the &quot;February 26 2009&quot; ip-to-country file.<br>
On March 10, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.10. It includes:<br>
Update Tor to 0.2.1.13-alpha<br>
Update Firefox to 3.0.7<br>
Update Pidgin to 2.5.5</p>

<p>On March 31, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.11. It includes:<br>
Update Firefox to 3.0.8<br>
Add Italian language bundles<br>
Update Torbutton to 1.2.1<br>
Update Vidalia to 0.1.12</p>

<p>On March 21, we released Torbutton 1.2.1, it includes:<br>

bugfix: bug 908: Make UserAgentSwitcher&#39;s &#39;default&#39; button restore Torbutton&#39;s spoofed user agent if Tor is enabled.<br>
bugfix: bug 909: Get Torbutton to &quot;properly&quot; react to users changing their Firefox cookie lifetime settings as opposed to using the Torbutton interface.<br>
bugfix: bug 834: Fix session saving and startup issues<br>
bugfix: bug 875: Removed docShell == null popup during toggle for some users<br>
bugfix: bug 910: fixed a locale spoofing issue in navigator.appVersion<br>
bugfix: bug 747: Attempt to fix &#39;fullscreen&#39; resizing issues.<br>
bugfix: Stop-gap timezone spoofing fix for Linux and Mac for FF3. Requires a one-line patch to Firefox for Windows to work.<br>
bugfix: Clear SSL Session IDs on toggle. (See FF Bug 448747)<br>
misc: bug 931: Added a socks v4 vs v5 version choice to custom prefs.<br>
misc: bug 836: redesign startup preference window to make it more understandable<br>
misc: Torbutton now presents itself as Windows FF3.0.7.</p>

<p>On March 16, we released TorVM 0.0.1 as a testing release for user feedback and testing. More about TorVM can be read at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torvm/" title="https://www.torproject.org/torvm/">https://www.torproject.org/torvm/</a></p>

<p>Vidalia 0.1.12 16-Mar-2009<br>
 o Fix a bug in the hidden service settings configuration class that<br>
 could lead to compile errors in Visual Studio and on IRIX.<br>
 o Fix a build error that occurred on IRIX when using the MIPSPro<br>
 compiler. Patch from Matthew Saunier.<br>
 o Remove two duplicated strings in the Spanish translation of Qt&#39;s<br>
 internal strings (qt_es.po). The duplicated strings caused build<br>
 errors when building with Qt 4.5. (Ticket #469)<br>
 o Remove the code that altered PublishServerDescriptor when becoming a<br>
 bridge, since Tor handles that itself now, and ensure that BridgeRelay<br>
 is reset when going from bridge to just-a-client mode.<br>
 o Remove an unnecessary #include from helpbrowser.cpp.<br>
 o Add an application icon based on Tor&#39;s logo to the vidalia.desktop<br>
 file.</p>

<p>Vidalia 0.2.0 19-Mar-2009<br>
 o Add support for changing UI languages without having to restart<br>
 Vidalia.<br>
 o Add preliminary support for using the KDE Marble widget for the<br>
 network map. It&#39;s currently a compile-time option and is disabled by<br>
 default.<br>
 o Add support for displaying Tor&#39;s plaintext port warnings. Also gives<br>
 the user the option to disable future warnings.<br>
 o Add an interface for displaying the geographic distribution of<br>
 clients who have recently used a bridge operator&#39;s relay.<br>
 o Add tooltips to tree items in the help browser&#39;s table of contents. Some<br>
 of the help topic labels are a bit long.<br>
 o Switch to a simpler About dialog and move the license information to a<br>
 separate HTML-formatted display.<br>
 o Switch to a simpler drag-and-drop installer in the OS X bundles.<br>
 o Switch to an MSI-based installer on Windows.<br>
 o Clear the list of default CA certificates used by QSslSocket before adding<br>
 the only one we care about. Suggested by coderman.<br>
 o Support building with Visual Studio again.<br>
 o Add a Debian package structure from dererk.<br>
 o Updated Albanian, Czech, Finnish, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian,<br>
 Swedish, Turkish and many other translations.</p>

<p>The Vidalia 0.2.0 release was also posted to the blog,<br>

<p>*<em>Design, develop, and implement enhancements<br>
*</em><br>
The Torbutton 1.2.1 update fixes a number of bugs that protect users in censored countries. Continued work on TorVM for easier and safer usage of Tor. Continued development of the secure updater client for Tor.</p>

<p>*<em>Architecture and technical design docs for Tor enhancements<br>
related to blocking-resistance.<br>
*</em><br>
Nick wrote up a blog entry describing our current plans for making<br>
libevent (and ultimately) Tor work well on Windows:<br>

<p>*<em>Grow the Tor network and user base. Outreach.<br>
*</em><br>
Andrew attended the LibrePlanet 2009 conference, <a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/" title="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/</a>. Discussed Tor, free network services, and free software.</p>

<p>Karsten, Sebastian, and others helped organize and then attended Pet-Con 2009, <a href="http://www.pet-con.org/index.php/PET_Convention_2009.1" title="http://www.pet-con.org/index.php/PET\_Convention\_2009.1">http://www.pet-con.org/index.php/PET_Convention_2009.1</a>.</p>

<p>Nick wrote a blog post about the secure updater for Tor, codenamed Thandy, for Google&#39;s Open Source blog: <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/03/thandy-secure-update-for-tor.html" title="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/03/thandy-secure-update-for-tor.html">http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/03/thandy-secure-update-for-t...</a></p>

<p>Finished analyzing directory archives from February 2006 to February<br>
2009. This analysis gives a slightly better picture of the Tor network<br>
than the analysis of the 2008 data. The analysis shows that there is a<br>
clear trend reversal in the number of German relays in 2008, , but for other countries the number of relays has continued to increase.</p>

<p>On March 17, Roger attended a hearing at the US Sentencing Commission,<br>
where Seth Schoen from EFF was testifying in opposition to a new &quot;if<br>
you use a proxy when committing a crime, it&#39;s a sophisticated crime so<br>
you get more jail-time&quot; clause they were considering. It turned out one<br>
of the commissioners is an avid Tor user, so they were sympathetic to<br>
his testimony.</p>

<p>On March 24-25, Roger and Andrew met with the Psiphon team in Toronto.<br>
We taught them about Tor&#39;s perspective on blocking-resistance, and about<br>
our bridges design. We also helped review their future design plans. We<br>
still have concerns that their closed design and implementation will<br>
ultimately mean they are less effective than they could be, but it&#39;s<br>
good to have alternate circumvention approaches available.</p>

<p>Tor (in combination with EFF) got accepted to Google Summer of Code<br>
2009. Google will be funding roughly 5 students to work on Tor-related<br>
development projects over this coming summer:<br>
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/eff-and-tor-google-summer-code-2009" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/eff-and-tor-google-summer-code-2009">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/eff-and-tor-google-summer-code-2009</a><br>
Our current thoughts are to focus on porting Polipo to Windows; improving<br>
usability and features for Torbutton; working harder to get WML support<br>
into Pootle, so people can translate our website with a browser; and<br>
further work on Thandy to make it scale better when 100000 users all<br>
try to upgrade in the same day.</p>

<p>Hal Roberts released his Berkman Center report on the &quot;landscape of<br>
circumvention technologies&quot; as of 2007, which recommends Tor and Psiphon:<br>

<p>Roger and Nick participated in the Codecon program committee, and helped<br>
to choose a variety of good development projects to showcase in April. Two<br>
of these turned out to be libevent (including the new Windows work),<br>
and Torflow:<br>

<p>Roger had lunch on March 4 with Micah Sherr, a PhD student at Penn who<br>
is working on a new path selection algorithm for Tor, that tries to<br>
minimize path latency rather than maximize bandwidth. Roger poked some<br>
holes in his design, and hopefully will help him over the next few months<br>
to fix them. You can read more about Micah&#39;s design in Section 4.3 of the<br>
&quot;performance.pdf&quot; document.</p>

<p>We worked with Global Voices to help them update their &quot;guide to blogging<br>
anonymously&quot;:<br>
 <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/updated-guide-blogging-anonymously" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/updated-guide-blogging-anonymously">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/updated-guide-blogging-anonymously</a><br>
In particular, we updated it to include recommendations for using Tor<br>
Browser Bundle, since TBB didn&#39;t exist when the guide was first written.</p>

<p>*<em>Preconfigured privacy (circumvention) bundles for USB or LiveCD.<br>
*</em><br>
On March 10, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.10. It includes:<br>
Update Tor to 0.2.1.13-alpha<br>
Update Firefox to 3.0.7<br>
Update Pidgin to 2.5.5</p>

<p>On March 31, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.11. It includes:<br>
Update Firefox to 3.0.8<br>
Add Italian language bundles<br>
Update Torbutton to 1.2.1<br>

<p>*<em>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.<br>
*</em><br>
From the changelog item from Vidalia 0.1.12:<br>
 o Remove the code that altered PublishServerDescriptor when becoming a<br>
 bridge, since Tor handles that itself now, and ensure that BridgeRelay<br>
 is reset when going from bridge to just-a-client mode.</p>

<p>*<em>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.<br>
*</em><br>
Roger and Steven wrote the Performance Roadmap as published at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/2009-03-12-performance-roadmap-press-release.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/press/2009-03-12-performance-roadmap-press-release.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/press/2009-03-12-performance-roadmap-press-re...</a></p>

<p>*<em>Footprints from Tor Browser Bundle.<br>
*</em><br>
March 17, updated research on traces left behind by the Tor Browser Bundle. The current document can be found at <a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt" title="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/docs/traces.txt</a>.</p>
