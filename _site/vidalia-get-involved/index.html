<div class="post">
<p>Hello everyone, for those who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m the one that&#39;s taking care of Vidalia these days.</p>

<p>The other day I was contacted by paulproteus in the #vidalia IRC channel about an initiative they (OpenHatch) are organizing called &quot;Build It&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The idea</strong></p>

<p>Open Source projects live and die depending on contributors and people that want to see the project evolve, but this isn&#39;t so easy sometimes.<br>
The guys behind the Build It initiative have a theory about this difficulty:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...lots of users of free desktop software want to get involved in customizing or contributing to the project&#39;s development, but they haven&#39;t gotten to the first step of getting the program to compile.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I&#39;m a Gentoo user for years now, the compilation part comes naturally to me and I haven&#39;t thought of this issue that way but it&#39;s an interesting approach.</p>

<p><strong>The event</strong></p>

<p>This week, people involved in Vidalia and other Open Source projects will be at a specific time online to help users (future developers, may be :) ) jump over this compilation wall. Particularly, Vidalia is scheduled for this Friday at 13:00 UTC in the same place as usual: #vidalia at OFTC.</p>

<p>While this event is taking place on a particular day and a particular time, I&#39;m online all the time (even when I&#39;m not in front of the computer). So if you want to contribute to Vidalia or any of the projects around Tor (or Tor itself), don&#39;t hesitate, just get online and start typing, but be patient and stick around. Also, you&#39;d probably want to read this: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en</a></p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Buld It initiative, you can ask in #openhatch at Freenode, or read here: <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build_it" title="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build\_it">https://openhatch.org/wiki/Build_it</a></p>
