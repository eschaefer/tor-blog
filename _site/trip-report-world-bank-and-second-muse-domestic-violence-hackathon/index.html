          <h2>Trip Report: World Bank and Second Muse Domestic Violence Hackathon</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Jan 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Over the weekend, I attended the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hacking-against-domestic-violence">Hacking against Domestic Violence</a> event in Washington DC, sponsored by the World Bank and Second Muse. I was there to help define problem statements, think about security and privacy risks of the solutions, and to help judge the solutions crafted by the attendees. A total of 10 teams congealed over the weekend. Everyone had creative solutions to the problem statements. Generally the sheer quality of output and enthusiasm was the first thing I noticed about all of the teams and their apps. Everyone in DC focused on mobile phone compatibility, even if their solution worked on the general web itself. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vdhackathon/">photos</a> available from the 7 involved countries.</p>

<p>I ended up spending most of my time with the team working to <a href="http://vdhackathon.pbworks.com/w/page/62827130/Protocols%20to%20Protect%20Survivors%20from%20Surveillance">develop protocols to protect survivors from surveillance</a>. We called ourselves Team Fuerza. The <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eandrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/2013-01-27-presentation.html">full presentation</a> is available. A volunteer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x9ubvC4Ai8">recorded a video</a> of the presentation as well. Related images and videos are uploaded to my <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eandrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/">Tor people site</a>.</p>

<p>Because I was involved with a team, I volunteered to give up my voting rights on the judges panel to avoid any issues. I then ended up presenting for the team for the status update and final presentation.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great two days and the team made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. A big thanks to <a href="https://people.torproject.org/%7Eandrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/WorldBankTeamFuerza-smile.jpg">the team</a> (Sarah, Az, Cid, Adriana, Andrew, and Justin), SecondMuse, the World Bank, and all of the attendees for their efforts in holding a hackathon in 7 countries simultaneously.</p>

<p>The World Bank and Second Muse should have their final press release and announcement of the results soon.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2013-02-08: World Bank accounces their <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/01/22/domestic-violence-hackathon-smartphone-lifesaver">press release</a> about the hackathon. Team Fuerza, won the USA hackathon!</p>
