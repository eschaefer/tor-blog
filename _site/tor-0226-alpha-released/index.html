          <h2>Tor 0.2.2.6-alpha released</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Dec 2009</p>

<div class="event">
<p>On November 19, we released the latest in the Tor alpha series, version 0.2.2.6-alpha. This release lays the groundwork for many upcoming features:<br>
support for the new lower-footprint &quot;microdescriptor&quot; directory design,<br>
future-proofing our consensus format against new hash functions or<br>
other changes, and an Android port. It also makes Tor compatible with<br>
the upcoming OpenSSL 0.9.8l release, and fixes a variety of bugs.</p>

<p>It can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en</a></p>

<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Directory authorities can now create, vote on, and serve multiple<br>
parallel formats of directory data as part of their voting process.<br>
Partially implements Proposal 162: &quot;Publish the consensus in<br>
multiple flavors&quot;.</li>
<li>Directory authorities can now agree on and publish small summaries<br>
of router information that clients can use in place of regular<br>
server descriptors. This transition will eventually allow clients<br>
to use far less bandwidth for downloading information about the<br>
network. Begins the implementation of Proposal 158: &quot;Clients<br>
download consensus + microdescriptors&quot;.</li>
<li>The directory voting system is now extensible to use multiple hash<br>
algorithms for signatures and resource selection. Newer formats<br>
are signed with SHA256, with a possibility for moving to a better<br>
hash algorithm in the future.</li>
<li>New DisableAllSwap option. If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all<br>
current and future memory pages via mlockall(). On supported<br>
platforms (modern Linux and probably BSD but not Windows or OS X),<br>
this should effectively disable any and all attempts to page out<br>
memory. This option requires that you start your Tor as root --<br>
if you use DisableAllSwap, please consider using the User option<br>
to properly reduce the privileges of your Tor.</li>
<li>Numerous changes, bugfixes, and workarounds from Nathan Freitas<br>
to help Tor build correctly for Android phones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Work around a security feature in OpenSSL 0.9.8l that prevents our<br>
handshake from working unless we explicitly tell OpenSSL that we<br>
are using SSL renegotiation safely. We are, but OpenSSL 0.9.8l<br>
won&#39;t work unless we say we are.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a crash bug when trying to initialize the evdns module in<br>
Libevent 2. Bugfix on 0.2.1.16-rc.</li>
<li>Stop logging at severity &#39;warn&#39; when some other Tor client tries<br>
to establish a circuit with us using weak DH keys. It&#39;s a protocol<br>
violation, but that doesn&#39;t mean ordinary users need to hear about<br>
it. Fixes the bug part of bug 1114. Bugfix on 0.1.0.13.</li>
<li>Do not refuse to learn about authority certs and v2 networkstatus<br>
documents that are older than the latest consensus. This bug might<br>
have degraded client bootstrapping. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.<br>
Spotted and fixed by xmux.</li>
<li>Fix numerous small code-flaws found by Coverity Scan Rung 3.</li>
<li>If all authorities restart at once right before a consensus vote,<br>
nobody will vote about &quot;Running&quot;, and clients will get a consensus<br>
with no usable relays. Instead, authorities refuse to build a<br>
consensus if this happens. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 1066.</li>
<li>If your relay can&#39;t keep up with the number of incoming create<br>
cells, it would log one warning per failure into your logs. Limit<br>
warnings to 1 per minute. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre10; fixes bug 1042.</li>
<li>Bridges now use &quot;reject *:*&quot; as their default exit policy. Bugfix<br>
on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1113.</li>
<li>Fix a memory leak on directory authorities during voting that was<br>
introduced in 0.2.2.1-alpha. Found via valgrind.</li>
</ul>
