<p>Your job would be to work on Torbutton and patches to our Firefox-based browser, as well as a potential Android port. This would be a contractor position likely starting in October and going through Q1 2013, with the possibility of later in 2013 and beyond. There may also be a possibility for part-time work prior to October.</p>

<p>The purpose of our browser is to build a private-by-design reference implementation of &quot;Do Not Track&quot;, but through the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy">alteration of browser behavior</a> and without the need for <a href="br%20/%3E%0Ahttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-private-browsing-modes-do-not-track-vs-real-privacy-design">regulation or begging</a>.</p>

<p>Your job will include triaging, diagnosing, and fixing bugs; looking for and resolving web privacy issues; responding on short notice to security issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on implementing new features and web behavior changes.</p>

<p>We&#39;d also need help making our code more maintainable, testable, and mergeable by upstream. Sometimes, we need to drop everything and scramble to implement last-minute fixes, or to deploy urgent security updates. You&#39;d also be reviewing other people&#39;s code, designs, and academic research papers, and looking for ways to improve upon them.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en">job posting</a> for information on how to apply and what you need to send in with your application.</p>

<p>For an even more detailed overview of the full breadth and depth of the work you&#39;d be doing, have a look at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/">The Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser</a>, especially <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#DesignRequirements">The Design Requirements</a> section.</p>
