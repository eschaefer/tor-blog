<p>Tor 0.2.2.17-alpha introduces a feature to make it harder for clients to use one-hop circuits (which can put the exit relays at higher risk, plus unbalance the network); fixes a big bug in bandwidth accounting for relays that want to limit their monthly bandwidth use; fixes a big pile of bugs in how clients tolerate temporary network failure; and makes our adaptive circuit build timeout feature (which improves client performance if your network is fast while not breaking things if your network is slow) better handle bad networks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.17-alpha - 2010-09-30<br>
o Major features:<br>
- Exit relays now try harder to block exit attempts from unknown<br>
relays, to make it harder for people to use them as one-hop proxies<br>
a la tortunnel. Controlled by the refuseunknownexits consensus<br>
parameter (currently enabled), or you can override it on your<br>
relay with the RefuseUnknownExits torrc option. Resolves bug 1751.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (0.2.1.x and earlier):<br>
- Fix a bug in bandwidth accounting that could make us use twice<br>
the intended bandwidth when our interval start changes due to<br>
daylight saving time. Now we tolerate skew in stored vs computed<br>
interval starts: if the start of the period changes by no more than<br>
50% of the period&#39;s duration, we remember bytes that we transferred<br>
in the old period. Fixes bug 1511; bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.<br>
- Always search the Windows system directory for system DLLs, and<br>
nowhere else. Bugfix on 0.1.1.23; fixes bug 1954.<br>
- When you&#39;re using bridges and your network goes away and your<br>
bridges get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks<br>
connection (if the network is back), rather than waiting up to an<br>
hour to try fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1981.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):<br>
- Fix compilation on Windows. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha; related to<br>
bug 1797.<br>
- Fix a segfault that could happen when operating a bridge relay with<br>
no GeoIP database set. Fixes bug 1964; bugfix on 0.2.2.15-alpha.<br>
- The consensus bandwidth-weights (used by clients to choose fast<br>
relays) entered an unexpected edge case in September where<br>
Exits were much scarcer than Guards, resulting in bad weight<br>
recommendations. Now we compute them using new constraints that<br>
should succeed in all cases. Also alter directory authorities to<br>
not include the bandwidth-weights line if they fail to produce<br>
valid values. Fixes bug 1952; bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha.<br>
- When weighting bridges during path selection, we used to trust<br>
the bandwidths they provided in their descriptor, only capping them<br>
at 10MB/s. This turned out to be problematic for two reasons:<br>
Bridges could claim to handle a lot more traffic then they<br>
actually would, thus making more clients pick them and have a<br>
pretty effective DoS attack. The other issue is that new bridges<br>
that might not have a good estimate for their bw capacity yet<br>
would not get used at all unless no other bridges are available<br>
to a client. Fixes bug 1912; bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.</p>

<p>o Major bugfixes (on the circuit build timeout feature, 0.2.2.x):<br>
- Ignore cannibalized circuits when recording circuit build times.<br>
This should provide for a minor performance improvement for hidden<br>
service users using 0.2.2.14-alpha, and should remove two spurious<br>
notice log messages. Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug 1740.<br>
- Simplify the logic that causes us to decide if the network is<br>
unavailable for purposes of recording circuit build times. If we<br>
receive no cells whatsoever for the entire duration of a circuit&#39;s<br>
full measured lifetime, the network is probably down. Also ignore<br>
one-hop directory fetching circuit timeouts when calculating our<br>
circuit build times. These changes should hopefully reduce the<br>
cases where we see ridiculous circuit build timeouts for people<br>
with spotty wireless connections. Fixes part of bug 1772; bugfix<br>
on 0.2.2.2-alpha.<br>
- Prevent the circuit build timeout from becoming larger than<br>
the maximum build time we have ever seen. Also, prevent the time<br>
period for measurement circuits from becoming larger than twice that<br>
value. Fixes the other part of bug 1772; bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.</p>

<p>o Minor features:<br>
- When we run out of directory information such that we can&#39;t build<br>
circuits, but then get enough that we can build circuits, log when<br>
we actually construct a circuit, so the user has a better chance of<br>
knowing what&#39;s going on. Fixes bug 1362.<br>
- Be more generous with how much bandwidth we&#39;d use up (with<br>
accounting enabled) before entering &quot;soft hibernation&quot;. Previously,<br>
we&#39;d refuse new connections and circuits once we&#39;d used up 95% of<br>
our allotment. Now, we use up 95% of our allotment, AND make sure<br>
that we have no more than 500MB (or 3 hours of expected traffic,<br>
whichever is lower) remaining before we enter soft hibernation.<br>
- If we&#39;ve configured EntryNodes and our network goes away and/or all<br>
our entrynodes get marked down, optimistically retry them all when<br>
a new socks application request appears. Fixes bug 1882.<br>
- Add some more defensive programming for architectures that can&#39;t<br>
handle unaligned integer accesses. We don&#39;t know of any actual bugs<br>
right now, but that&#39;s the best time to fix them. Fixes bug 1943.<br>
- Support line continuations in the torrc config file. If a line<br>
ends with a single backslash character, the newline is ignored, and<br>
the configuration value is treated as continuing on the next line.<br>
Resolves bug 1929.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x and earlier):<br>
- For bandwidth accounting, calculate our expected bandwidth rate<br>
based on the time during which we were active and not in<br>
soft-hibernation during the last interval. Previously, we were<br>
also considering the time spent in soft-hibernation. If this<br>
was a long time, we would wind up underestimating our bandwidth<br>
by a lot, and skewing our wakeup time towards the start of the<br>
accounting interval. Fixes bug 1789. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</p>

<p>o Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):<br>
- Resume generating CIRC FAILED REASON=TIMEOUT control port messages,<br>
which were disabled by the circuit build timeout changes in<br>
0.2.2.14-alpha. Bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha; fixes bug 1739.<br>
- Make sure we don&#39;t warn about missing bandwidth weights when<br>
choosing bridges or other relays not in the consensus. Bugfix on<br>
0.2.2.10-alpha; fixes bug 1805.<br>
- In our logs, do not double-report signatures from unrecognized<br>
authorities both as &quot;from unknown authority&quot; and &quot;not<br>
present&quot;. Fixes bug 1956, bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha.</p>
