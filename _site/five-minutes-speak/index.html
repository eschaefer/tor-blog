  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I was asked to give a five minute speech to open a panel in front of a number of policy makers and advisors in Washington, DC in the past few weeks. The discussion was under <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>. A number of people have encouraged me to publish the speech notes as a blog post, it is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here I am, a technologist in a room full of policy people. I&#39;ll stick<br>
 to what I know and try not to put anyone to sleep in the next five<br>
 minutes.</p>

<p>Technology is agnostic, who uses and how they use it matters. Roads,<br>
 cars, phones, email, websites are all technologies used for good and bad.<br>
 In the 1930s, the feds and police warned of mass chaos if the interstate<br>
 highway system was built in the US. The ability for criminals to quickly<br>
 transit between cities was of grave concern. Crime would spread faster,<br>
 further, and this would hasten the breakdown of the very fabric of the<br>
 American society, community. Time has shown the benefits vastly outweighed<br>
 the costs. This same principle has shown to be true of the internet<br>
 and computer technology. Sure, we may have new kinds of crime with botnets,<br>
 zombies, phishing, but do we really? Lying, impersonation, and tricking<br>
 someone into doing your work are the same crimes they have been for the<br>
 past few millenia. It&#39;s just that the substrate that is used, has changed.<br>
 What are some of the largest companies in the world? GE, IBM, Apple,<br>
 Microsoft, Google. What one should or should not do is policy and law,<br>
 what one can actually do or not do is technology.</p>

<p>Circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools used in a free world can be<br>
 a minor annoyance, i.e. wikileaks used wikis, ssl, email, and yes, tor,<br>
 but in the end, it&#39;s an annoyance. We don&#39;t have people in the streets<br>
 rioting trying to overthrow our govt. Wikipedia uses the same technology<br>
 in wikis, ssl, and email. Everyone loves Wikipedia and considers it a net positive.</p>

<p>The same circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools are deadly to<br>
 repressive regimes. The free flow of information and education are of<br>
 great concern to a regime trying to control the horizontal and vertical<br>
 of every day life. The tactics a regime can use are legal, technical,<br>
 and physical. The regime can switch between tactics, generally<br>
 depending upon what&#39;s economical and most effective.</p>

<p>Roughly 1 billion people are online in some way. Berkman did a study<br>
 that found roughly 2% of that billion know what a proxy is, or even that<br>
 technology exists to circumvent internet censorship. 98% of the world<br>
 accepts that facebook, google, cnn, and the bbc, are blocked and doesn&#39;t<br>
 try to find ways around it. This doesn&#39;t even broach the topic of online<br>
 privacy relating to commercial entities nor law enforcement and<br>
 intelligence agencies trying to learn the who, what, where, and how of your Internet activities.</p>

<p>Arguing about which proxy technology should get all of the funding and<br>
 attention is silly. The budgets and adversaries vastly outweigh the<br>
 funding and research into proxies. It&#39;s not a zero-sum game, and<br>
 the different technologies take very different approaches to success;<br>
 freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, psiphon, and web proxies play a game of cat<br>
 and mouse with ip addresses and sometimes encryption; tor uses the<br>
 strategy of R&amp;D and protecting ones anonymity and privacy first, the<br>
 secondary effects of this are well-suited to circumvention too. Tor,<br>
 freegate, psiphon, and vpns sum up to roughly \$50m in funding from the US govt<br>
 of the past few years. Only a very small fraction of that total has made it to actual technology. Compare that to the billions spent on snakeoil<br>
 black box technology by the DoD and intelligence agencies preparing for<br>
 a cyberwar arms race, much like the nuclear arms race, to deter other<br>
 nations from attacking us.</p>

<p>I talked to a member of a terrorist organization in Vietnam. He&#39;s been<br>
 stalked, harassed, and had everything confiscated multiple times by his<br>
 government. You know his organization as Deutsche Welle. He&#39;s a<br>
 reporter. He had no idea how his plans, documents, and contacts were<br>
 being discovered and used against him. His ability to understand the<br>
 differences between Tor, JAP, and Freegate was like asking which tires<br>
 are best for gravel, snow, or tarmac. The question he didn&#39;t even know<br>
 to ask is, &quot;What are safe and secure computing and online practices?&quot;<br>
 to use my analogy, &quot;what car do I want for those tires? the answer is<br>
 a rally car.&quot; I spent 4 hours going over how the internet works,<br>
 how to think about adversaries online, what is ssl, what it means, what<br>
 are phishing, viruses, botnets, and state-sponsored malware. By the<br>
 end of the 4th hour, he understood how tor is different than a simple<br>
 vpn or proxy server, and when to use tor and when it isn&#39;t needed. 3.5h<br>
 of that discussion was basic operational, computer, and online security<br>
 and safe practices.</p>

<p>So where does this leave us? It leaves us with a mix of education,<br>
 technology, and many, many unanswered questions. This is a young field<br>
 overall. As the censorship providers and technologies get better, so<br>
 will those circumvention technologies. Educating users about internet<br>
 safety, risks, and making the tools vastly easier and safer to use<br>
 should be a goal.</p>

<p>Tor published a &quot;10 things to think about circumvention tools&quot; paper to<br>
 try to distill what we&#39;ve learned over the past 10 years of doing this.<br>
 In a few of these areas, tor is not the best choice, for now.</p>

<p>What about technology? Isn&#39;t it going to save us all? Currently,<br>
 freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, and web proxies are looking for money to fund<br>
 their growing infrastructure costs. The more users you have, the more<br>
 servers, more bandwidth, and more costs you incur. Its a quick way to<br>
 spend lots of money and get lots of users. However becoming the ISP for<br>
 the world gets very expensive, very quickly as you scale up to hundreds<br>
 of millions of users. Look at the infrastructures of google, facebook,<br>
 yahoo, and microsoft to see the challenges that lie ahead for these tools.</p>

<p>Tor and &quot;distributed tools&quot; look to improve the research and development<br>
 and rely on the scaling of users to both provide the circumvention and<br>
 grow to become a self-sustaining ISP to the world. We have only begun<br>
 to see the power and effects of these technologies with bittorrent, jap,<br>
 skype, freenet, i2p, and tor.</p>
