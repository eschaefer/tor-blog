<div class="event">
<p>We&#39;re excited to be doing a set of posts over at <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org">KnightPulse</a> about anonymity and how it can help foster citizen journalism. In order to provide more professional content and topics, we&#39;re working with <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/">Jillian C. York</a> as our lead author for the series.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/08/11/24/why-browse-internet-anonymously">video interview and full post</a> are available. Expect a series of these over the next few months. Feel free to suggest relevant topics or people willing to be interviewed, anonymously or not, about their experiences with Tor and citizen journalism. Bonus points if you want to do a video interview.</p>

<p>This is also our first experience doing a video interview over Skype. Skype repeatedly cut out and lost all connections to its servers a few times. The video is edited to piece it back together. Not sure if it&#39;s just Skype for Linux that has these issues.</p>

<p>All in all, a great experience and looking forward to working with Knight Pulse and Jillian.</p>
