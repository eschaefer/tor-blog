**Scalability**  
From the 0.2.1.14-rc changelog:  
Clients replace entry guards that were chosen more than a few months ago. This change should significantly improve client performance, especially once more people upgrade, since relays that have been a guard for a long time are currently overloaded.

Continued work on TorFlow, a tool for scanning the public Tor network and detecting misconfigured, overloaded, and evil nodes.
