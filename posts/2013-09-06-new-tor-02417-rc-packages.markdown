There's a new [Tor 0.2.4.17-rc](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029344.html) to hopefully help mitigate some of the problems with the [botnet](http://blog.fox-it.com/2013/09/05/large-botnet-cause-of-recent-tor-network-overload/) [issues](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients) Tor is experiencing. All packages, including the beta Tor Browser Bundles, have been updated. Relay operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest versions, since it mostly has server-side improvements in it, but users will hopefully benefit from upgrading too. Please try it out and let us know.
