There's a new [Tor 0.2.4.16-rc](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029344.html) out and all packages, including the beta Tor Browser Bundles, have been updated. The stable Tor Browser Bundles have also been updated to fix a bug in the last release which prevented the language packs from working (which resulted in all of the bundles being in English!). We're very sorry about this.
