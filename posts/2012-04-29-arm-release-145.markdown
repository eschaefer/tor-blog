Hi all. A new release of [arm](http://www.atagar.com/arm/) is now available which includes [numerous fixes](http://www.atagar.com/arm/releaseNotes.php) of mounting importance. In particular this corrects several issues around arm's connection panel, terminal glitches due to [disruption of the curses module by readline](https://gitweb.torproject.org/arm.git/commitdiff/b86e5bf), and [incompatibility with tor's new development releases](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-April/023961.html).

This release does not include any new features, nor are any planned in the near future. Most of my attention is going to [stem](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/stem) right now, and my next foray into arm will be to [work with Ravi](https://www.torproject.org/about/gsocProposal/gsoc12-proposal-stemImprovements.html) to migrate it to the new library this summer. That said, if you encounter any problems then let me know! -Damian
