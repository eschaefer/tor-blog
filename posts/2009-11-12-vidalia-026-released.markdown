On November 2, we released Vidalia 0.2.6. Primarily a bugfix release for OS X issues. The changed items are:

- Remove the erroneous comma in the default vidalia.conf in the  
 Mac OS X drag-and-drop bundle, since we now dump whatever the  
 user types into a QString rather than parsing it into a  
 QStringList.
- Updated the Arabic, Russian and Slovenian translations.

Packages for OS X and Windows can be found at [https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/](https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/ "https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/").
