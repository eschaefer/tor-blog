Howcast produced a quick video for the masses on [how to circumvent censorship](http://www.howcast.com/videos/90601-How-To-Circumvent-an-Internet-Proxy). We were technical consultants for this video. It's tough to talk about Tor, when the first question you're trying to answer is "What is a proxy? And why do I care?"

Howcast did a great job for a high-level overview of circumvention technologies in four minutes.
