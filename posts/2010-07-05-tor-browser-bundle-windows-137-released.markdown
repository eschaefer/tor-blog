On July 4th, we released Tor Browser Bundle 1.3.7 for Microsoft Windows. This is merely a security update release for Firefox and Pidgin. You can download this at [https://torproject.org/torbrowser](https://torproject.org/torbrowser "https://torproject.org/torbrowser").

The only changes are:

- update to Firefox 3.5.10 to fix some security issues
- update to Pidgin 2.7.1r2 to fix some security issues
