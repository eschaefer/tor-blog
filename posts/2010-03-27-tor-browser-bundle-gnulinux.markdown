Tor Browser Bundle for GNU/Linux is now available for x86 and x86\_64 architectures in 12 languages.

The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser and is self-contained.

You can download it from the [Tor Browser](http://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/) page which also has instructions about how to extract and use it.

The bundle comes with the following software:

- [Tor 0.2.2.10-alpha](https://www.torproject.org/)
- [Vidalia 0.2.7](https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/) -- cross-platform controller GUI for the Tor software
- [Polipo 1.0.4.1](https://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) -- caching web proxy
- [Firefox 3.5.8](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) -- web browser
- [Torbutton 1.2.4](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) -- Firefox extension to enable or disable the browser's use of Tor
- [NoScript 1.9.9.57](http://noscript.net/) -- Firefox extension to only allow scripts from trusted sites
- [BetterPrivacy 1.4.7](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623) -- Firefox extension to protect against supercookies

This is a beta version, so please test it and [file bugs](https://bugs.torproject.org/)!
