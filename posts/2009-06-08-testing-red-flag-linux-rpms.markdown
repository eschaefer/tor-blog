A company in China has produced its own distribution of linux, called [Red Flag Linux](http://www.redflag-linux.com/). Various reports are that Internet cafes are [being forced to install it](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/microsoft%20to%20linux-12022008144416.html). We have no confirmed reports of this actually occurring. However, a few users have asked for rpms anyway.

If you happen to run this Red Flag distribution, we have some test rpms based on tor 0.2.1.15-rc for you.

The [binary itself](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.i386.rpm) along with [signature](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.i386.rpm.asc) and [sha-1 hash](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.i386.rpm.sha1).

The [source rpm](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.src.rpm) along with [signature](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.src.rpm.asc) and [sha-1 hash](https://www.torproject.org/dist/rpm-redflag/tor-0.2.1.15.rc-tor.0.redflag6_0.src.rpm.sha1).

I welcome feedback.
