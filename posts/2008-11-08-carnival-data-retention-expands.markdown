We've [already asked](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor,-germany,-and-data-retention) about how to handle the forthcoming data retention directive in Germany.

A few more governments are either heading down that path, or already there:

- [Internet black boxes to record every email and website visit](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3384743/Internet-black-boxes-to-record-every-email-and-website-visit.html) at The Telegraph UK.
- [Data Retention in Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention#Data_retention_in_Denmark).
- [SORM-2 in Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM#SORM-2)
- [Sweden wants to record all cross-border communications](http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/8670/a/78367).

I suspect we'll see proposals for this in the USA soon enough.
