The [4th USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/call-for-papers) is calling for papers. The workshop will be held on August 18, 2014 and seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners working on means to study, detect, or circumvent Internet censorship.

Past iterations of the workshop featured a number of great Tor research papers including a proposal for [cloud-based onion routing](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/foci11/tech/final_files/Jones.pdf), our [OONI design paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final12.pdf), an [analysis of how the GFW blocks Tor](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final2.pdf), a [censorship analyzer for Tor](http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/12390-foci13-winter.pdf), and a [proposal for latency reduction in Tor circuits](http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/12395-foci13-nowlan.pdf).

Given the past success of the FOCI series, we are looking forward to another round of great Tor papers.

Paper submissions are due on Tuesday, May 13, 2014, 11:59 p.m. PDT.
