[Incognito](http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/) is an open source LiveDistro assisting you to securely and anonymously use the Internet almost anywhere you go. Incognito can be used from either a CD or a USB drive and has several Internet applications (Web browser, IRC client, Mail client, Instant messenger, etc.) pre-configured with security in mind, and all Internet traffic will be anonymized.

At the core of this anonymity is the Tor software and network. In recognition of the transparency, open source base, continued development, and improvement of the Incognito software, The Tor Project is proud to list Incognito as a licensee of the Tor brands.

Incognito has the right to use the Tor name and the Tor onion logo as needed. The high quality graphics will improve the user experience. The usage of the Tor brand will only further reinforce that Incognito is a legitimate solution using the Tor software.

We welcome the further cooperation and collaboration between Incognito and The  
Tor Project.
