As announced here, [http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2010/msg00033.html](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2010/msg00033.html "http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Feb-2010/msg00033.html"), we now produce rpms and debs of Tor and Vidalia for easier installation.

When using ubuntu, opensuse, fedora, centos/redhat, or debian, you can simply add our repositories to your package management application (yum, apt, apttitude, zypper, etc) and always have the latest -stable or -alpha tor and vidalia.

This is a direct result of hiring Erinn in December.
