If you were to give a non-technical person a brief overview of the Tor network, how would you begin? And if you had a picture or diagram to assist you, how would that look like?

We're looking for better visualizations of the Tor network as introductory material. Most people already know EFF's visualizations from [Tor's Overview page](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution). Recently, an [Italian hack meeting](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-January/027105.html) came up with a fun picture of how to imagine a Tor circuit. A discussion among Tor developers brought up an ugly, but potentially useful [analogy with road traffic](https://people.torproject.org/~karsten/tor-network-road-traffic.jpg).

Want to help make these visualizations better or suggest your own? Prettier drawings that we can actually show to the world are as useful as content-wise improvements what to add or leave out from these visualizations. Simply leave your ideas or links in the comments. Thanks!
