On July 5 and 6 we are holding an open hackfest at the [Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze](http://www.unifi.it/) in Florence, Italy.

Please attend if you have some interest in programming, advocacy, marketing, or (network security/anonymity/computer science/etc) research with Tor, or are willing to be persuaded to entertain an interest. :) Tor's a small project (in terms of number of developers) that could really use your help.

The majority language will be English, but there will be some Italian speakers at the hackfest.

More details can be found on the [Florence Hackfest](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2012FlorenceHackfest) wiki page.

See you in Florence!
