The Tor Browser Bundles have all been updated with some important security fixes and it is advised that all users upgrade. Geolocation has been disabled and some prefs added as a workaround for [bug 2338](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2338). A full list of changes is in [the diff](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blobdiff/bdf8d711b08935bbd37979270dc30347d1cb2c44..2c895ec8f004427744579f466a73a8ebb576c8ec:/build-scripts/config/prefs.js).
