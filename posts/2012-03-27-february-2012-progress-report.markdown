Our progress report for February 2012 is now available. It hightlights recent work with deep packet inspection and censorship circumvention in Iran and Kazakhstan. Also progress on a new tor status site based on new protocols, and general outreach and travels.

We implemented a new format this month to better reflect everything going on within Tor.
