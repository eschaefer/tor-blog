Both Roger Dingledine and Mike Perry will be giving talks at [DEFCON 16](http://www.defcon.org/) in Las Vegas.

[Roger's talk](http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Dingledine) will cover past and present security and anonymity issues with the Tor network and supporting software.

[Mike's talk](http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Perry) will present a security tool designed to snag insecure https cookies over open wifi networks - a vulnerability he [reported to bugtraq](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/Aug/0070.html) and major websites a full year ago that also makes these websites' ssl connections insecure over Tor. His hope is that releasing this tool will motivate websites to secure their cookies for wifi users, and thus also improve the security of Tor users who use them.
