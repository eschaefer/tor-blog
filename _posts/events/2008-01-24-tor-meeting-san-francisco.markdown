Hi, folks! I'm in the San Francisco area for the week, so I thought it would be good to have an impromptu meetup for Tor users, operators, and enthusiasts. So if that's you, and if you're in town, and you'd like to chat, hang out, or whatever, stop on by. I'll try to hang around for a couple of hours at least.
When: 7pm, Thursday.
Where: the Sugarlump Coffee Lounge, at 2862 24th St, at Bryant.
I hope you can make it!
