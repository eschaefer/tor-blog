Please join us tomorrow (August 13) as Philipp Winter presents"Towards a Censorship Analyser for Tor" at 3rd USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet (FOCI '13) in Washington, DC.

"Analysing censorship incidents targeting popular circumvention tools such as Tor can be a tedious task. Access to censoring networks is typically difficult to obtain and remote analysis is not always possible. Analysis is however feasible if users behind the censoring networks are given the opportunity to help."
