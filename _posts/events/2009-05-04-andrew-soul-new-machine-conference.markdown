The Soul of the New Machine, an international conference, will be held May 4 and 5, 2009, on the Berkeley campus. The conference will convene leading thinkers and practitioners to share best practices and develop new strategies for incorporating technology to address human rights abuses. It will also inspire the creation and advancement of innovative projects voters through the “Mobile Challenge,” a competition for using mobile technology in human rights investigations and advocacy.
