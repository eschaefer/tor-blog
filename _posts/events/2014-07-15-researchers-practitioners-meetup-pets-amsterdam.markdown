We have arranged for two rooms near the venue of [PETS](http://www.petsymposium.org) for an "unconference" around practical applications of privacy technology on the day before the symposium begins.

The meeting is intended to be a free-for-all for researchers and practitioners of privacy technologies. We encourage attendees to put together a few slides for a short lightning talk if you have something you would like to discuss. The lightning talks, if any, will start at 11:00.

Costs will be covered by the [Renewable Freedom Foundation](http://www.renewablefreedom.org).

The rooms are in [Science Park 904, University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/the-uva-in-amsterdam/locations/content/sciencepark/science-park.html):

The Main meeting room is B1.23, a computer lab on the first floor with movable desks on wheels. The room is publicly accessible so people do not need to go to the reception desk but can walk straight to B1.23. The second room is B1.45C, a meeting room for max 16 people. Both rooms have projectors and whiteboards.
