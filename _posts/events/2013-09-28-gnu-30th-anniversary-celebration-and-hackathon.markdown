Tor will be one of several fine software projects featured in the featured in the [GNU 30th anniversary celebration and hackathon](https://gnu.org/gnu30/celebration) at MIT. If you like to program, and you're interested in helping with Tor, sign up on the webpage and come on by!

Nick Mathewson, original co-programmer and current lead developer of the Tor program, will be there. Other Tor people in the greater Boston area may come by as well. We don't currently expect to have all of our sub-projects represented, but we'll try to put you in contact with the right people if you want to hack on something else.

We'll try to have a list of fun suggested projects for people to work on ahead of the event.
