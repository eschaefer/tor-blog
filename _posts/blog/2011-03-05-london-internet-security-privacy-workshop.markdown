We're helping to hold a mini " [unconference](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BarCamp)" on Internet security and privacy in London. It is Monday night (March 7) from 6 to 9 PM at the Main College Building, Room 116, [SOAS](http://www.soas.ac.uk/) just off Russell Square. The goal is to create an environment where the attendees can share information and learn about security and privacy on the Internet. All attendees are encouraged to present or facilitate a session. If you're in the area and want to learn or share, please stop by!

Updated 11 PM GMT with details and location.
