A couple of months ago, we created a proposal for a Tor Q&A page on Stack Exchange. The proposal moved into the commitment-phase shortly after, but we need more help to move the page into a live beta. If you would like to see a Q&A site for Tor, please visit our proposal page and click the "Commit!"-button: [http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor "http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor")

Thanks!
