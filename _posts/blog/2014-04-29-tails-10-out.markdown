Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.0, is out.

All users must [upgrade](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/) as soon as possible: this release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.23/).

For more information about what the 1.0 release means for Tails, and about its future, see the [full announcement](https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.0/).

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

- Security fixes
  - Upgrade the web browser to 24.5.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1 (Firefox 24.5.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
  - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1+tails1~d60.squeeze+1:
    - Based on 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.
    - Backport the fix for [bug #11464 on Tor Project's Trac](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11464). It adds client-side blacklists for all Tor directory authority keys that was vulnerable to Heartbleed. This protects clients in case attackers were able to compromise a majority of the authority signing and identity keys.

- Bugfixes
  - Disable inbound I2P connections. Tails already restricts incoming connections, but this change tells I2P about it.
  - Fix link to the system requirements documentation page in the Tails Upgrader error shown when too little RAM is available.

- Minor improvements
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.12-2~deb6u+1.
  - Import TorBrowser profile. This was forgotten in Tails 0.23 and even though we didn't explicitly set those preferences in that release they defaulted to the same values. This future-proofs us in case the defaults would ever change.
  - Import new custom version of Tor Launcher:
    - Based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.3.
    - Improve how Tor Launcher handles incomplete translation. ( [bug #11483 on Tor Project's Trac](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11483); more future-proof fix for [ticket #6885](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6885))
    - Remove the bridge settings prompt. ( [bug #11482 on Tor Project's Trac](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11482); closes [ticket #6934](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6934))
    - Always show bridge help button. ( [bug #11484 on Tor Project's Trac](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11484))

  - Integrate the new Tails logo into various places:
    - The website
    - The boot splash
    - The "About Tails" dialog

See the [online Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog) for technical details.
