Tor 0.2.3.7-alpha fixes a crash bug in 0.2.3.6-alpha introduced by the new v3 handshake. It also resolves yet another bridge address enumeration issue.

All packages are updated, with the exception of the OS X PPC packages. The build machine is down and packages will be built as soon as it is back online.

Changes in version 0.2.3.7-alpha - 2011-10-30  
**Major bugfixes:**

- If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,  
 don't process any further cells on it. We already avoid further  
 reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the  
 cells we'd already read. Fixes bug 4299; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha,  
 which was the first version where we might mark a connection for  
 close based on processing a cell on it.
- Fix a double-free bug that would occur when we received an invalid  
 certificate in a CERT cell in the new v3 handshake. Fixes bug 4343;  
 bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.
- Bridges no longer include their address in NETINFO cells on outgoing  
 OR connections, to allow them to blend in better with clients.  
 Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Reported by  
 "troll\_un". Fixes bug 4348; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha, when NETINFO  
 cells were introduced.

**Trivial fixes:**

- Fixed a typo in a hibernation-related log message. Fixes bug 4331;  
 bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by "tmpname0901".
