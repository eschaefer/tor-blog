Aaron and Virgil's [tor2web](http://tor2web.com) site has been picked up by [Wired's 27bstroke6 blog](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/12/tor-anonymized.html) and [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081215-tor2web-brings-anonymous-tor-sites-to-the-regular-web.html).

First off, I think it's a neat implementation of allowing non-Tor users access to the realm of .onion, aka hidden services. While I think using the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/) is incredibly easy, not everyone agrees with me. Neither Tor nor tor2web host any of the hidden service content. We don't know who does, nor who runs the hidden service. This brings me to my next thought. [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/quick-thoughts-tor2web)
