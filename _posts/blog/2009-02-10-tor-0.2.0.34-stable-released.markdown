Tor 0.2.0.34 features several more security-related fixes. You
should upgrade, especially if you run an exit relay (remote crash) or
a directory authority (remote infinite loop), or you're on an older
(pre-XP) or not-recently-patched Windows (remote exploit).

This release marks end-of-life for Tor 0.1.2.x. Those Tor versions have
many known flaws, and nobody should be using them. You should upgrade. If
you're using a Linux or BSD and its packages are obsolete, stop using
those packages and upgrade anyway.
