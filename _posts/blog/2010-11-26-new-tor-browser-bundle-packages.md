There are new browser bundles out with the updated Tor versions (0.2.2.19-alpha and 0.2.1.27) that work with the latest OpenSSL.

**Windows Tor Browser Bundles**  
 There were some controversial changes recently made to the Windows bundle, and for those I apologize. I have removed BetterPrivacy and NoScript from them pending further testing. The whole changelog:

**1.3.13: Released 2010-11-25**

-   update Tor to 0.2.1.27
-   update Pidgin to 2.7.5
-   update OpenSSL to 0.9.8p
-   fix Firefox extension install path so extensions show in the installed add-ons list
-   disable Firefox's ability to search the Windows registry path for system-wide  
     plugins and extensions (closes: [\#2118](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2118))
-   remove NoScript and BetterPrivacy from stable bundle until they receive more  
     testing
