We have heard from web server operators who are wondering how many of  
 their visitors are using Tor to do so.

We can now answer this question. We have an exit list archive back to  
 February 2010 and a tool to compare an Apache HTTP server log to these  
 lists. We can further guess how many of the requests come from Torbutton  
 users by looking at the user-agent string.

There's a lot of sensitive data involved here, which is why we give out  
 the archived exit lists and our tool so that web server operators can  
 run the comparison themselves. [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/visitor-or-script-tell-you-how-many-your-users-are-probably-tor-users)
