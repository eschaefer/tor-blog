Tor 0.2.1.22 rotates two of the seven v3 directory authority keys and  
locations, due to a security breach of some of the Torproject servers:

It also fixes a privacy problem in bridge directory authorities -- it  
would tell you its whole history of bridge descriptors if you make the  
right directory request.

Everybody should upgrade:

Changes in version 0.2.1.22 - 2010-01-19  
 o Directory authority changes:  
 - Rotate keys (both v3 identity and relay identity) for moria1  
 and gabelmoo.

o Major bugfixes:  
 - Stop bridge directory authorities from answering dbg-stability.txt  
 directory queries, which would let people fetch a list of all  
 bridge identities they track. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.
