The July 2011 Progress Report is at the bottom of this post and at [https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.pdf](https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.pdf "https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.pdf").

Highlights include continued progress on protocol obfuscating proxy, a new bridge guard design, outreach, scalability improvements, orbot updates, and a number of translation updates.

Update 2011-08-15: based on feedback, created a plaintext version of the pdf. It doesn't contain the images obviously, but does contain all of the content. Generated the text file via pandoc. The text file is here, [https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.txt](https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.txt "https://blog.torproject.org/files/2011-July-Monthly-Report.txt")
