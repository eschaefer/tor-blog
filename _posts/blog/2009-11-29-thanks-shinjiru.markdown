Earlier this year, we started looking for a new hosting location for a directory authority [outside the US and EU](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/time-directory-authority-outside-useu). After talking to a few ISPs, [Shinjiru Technology](http://www.shinjiru.com/) donated a high-bandwidth server to us. The server has been up and running for a few months now without issues. The staff has been great to work with and we'll soon turn this into a public directory authority for the public Tor Network.
This is a public thank you to Shinjiru for supporting online privacy and anonymity with Tor.
