Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.18, is out.

All users must upgrade as soon as possible.

[Download it now.](https://tails.boum.org/download/)

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

-   New features
    -   Support obfs3 bridges.
    -   Automatically install a custom list of additional packages chosen by the user at the beginning of every working session, and upgrade them once a network connection is established (technology preview).
-   Iceweasel
    -   Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.5esr-0+tails2\~bpo60+1.
    -   Update Torbrowser patches to current maint-2.4 branch (567682b).
    -   Torbutton 1.5.2, and various prefs hacks to fix breakage.
    -   HTTPS Everywhere 3.2
    -   NoScript 2.6.6.1-1
    -   Isolate DOM storage to first party URI, and enable DOM storage.
    -   Isolate the image cache per url bar domain.
    -   Update prefs to match the TBB's, fix bugs, and take advantage of the latest Torbrowser patches.
    -   Make prefs organization closer to the TBB's, and generally clean them up.
-   Bugfixes
    -   Linux 3.2.41-2+deb7u2.
    -   All Iceweasel prefs we set are now applied.
    -   Bring back support for proxies of type other than obfsproxy.
-   Minor improvements
    -   Set `kernel.dmesg_restrict=1`, and make `/proc/<pid>/` invisible and restricted for other users. It makes it slightly harder for an attacker to gather information that may allow them to escalate privileges.
    -   Install gnome-screenshot.
    -   Add a *About Tails* launcher in the *System* menu.
    -   Install GNOME accessibility themes.
    -   Use *Getting started...* as the homepage for the Tails documentation button.
    -   Disable audio preview in Nautilus.
-   Localization: many translation updates all over the place.

See the [online Changelog](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.18) for technical details.

**Known issue**

The web browser default search engine is Google, instead of the intended localized Startpage. You may select *Startpage HTTPS* in the search engine menu next to the Google icon.

**I want to try it / to upgrade!**
