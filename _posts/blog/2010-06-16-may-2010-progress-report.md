On May 31, we released Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 1.0.6. It contains the following updates:

-   Update NoScript to 1.9.9.80

On June 1st, we released Tor Browser Bundle for Linux 1.0.7. It uses an older glibc for better compatibility with older linux distributions.

On May 20, we released Vidalia 0.2.9. Fixes include Qt 4.6.2 compatibility, new cert, and some new translations.
