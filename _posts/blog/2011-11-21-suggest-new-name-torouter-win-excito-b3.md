The Torouter is the codename for a hardware project that aims to provide users with a device that can easily be configured to run as a Tor bridge or relay. We are currently working on two devices; the [Excito B3](https://www.excito.com/node/9) and the [DreamPlug](https://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/c-5-dreamplugs.aspx).

Having two devices that are both called "the Torouter" can be a bit confusing, so we would like your help in renaming the Excito B3 Torouter!

The best suggestion will not only be the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter, but the winner will also receive an Excito B3, a Tor t-shirt and stickers. Five runners-up will receive Tor t-shirts and stickers.

To suggest new names for the Excito B3 Torouter, send an email to *tor-assistants AT torproject.org* with "Torouter naming contest" in the subject. The deadline is December 5, 2011.

**UPDATE:** We have received a lot of good naming suggestions for the Excito B3 Torouter, thank you to everyone who emailed us! We have decided that the new name for the Excito B3 Torouter is **onionbox**. An email has gone out to the lucky winner of a B3, a t-shirt and some stickers, as well as five-runners up who will all get t-shirts and stickers.
