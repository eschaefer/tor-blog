Tor 0.2.1.15-rc marks the second release candidate for the 0.2.1.x  
 series. It fixes a major bug on fast exit relays, as well as a variety  
 of more minor bugs.

This is a release candidate! That means that we don't know of any  
 remaining show-stopping bugs, and this will become the new stable if  
 there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems  
 that you find. [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02115rc-released)
