The main academic reference for Tor is ["Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" by Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf). But that paper was published back in 2004, and Tor has evolved since then. So Steven Murdoch and Nick Mathewson are currently preparing an updated version of the Tor design paper, to include new design changes and research results concerning Tor over the last 8 years.

In this series of posts, we (Steven and Nick) will try to summarize the most interesting or significant changes to Tor's design since the publication of the original paper. We're only going to cover the stuff we think is most interesting, and we'll aim to do so in an interesting way.

We think this will be a three part series. In this first part, we'll cover the evolution of Tor's directory system, and some performance improvements in Tor's circuit creation and cell scheduling logic. [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/top-changes-tor-2004-design-paper-part-1)
