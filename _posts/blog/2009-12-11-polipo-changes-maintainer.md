Congratulations to Chrisd for assuming maintainership of the Polipo codebase from Juliusz. The full announcement is available at [the mailing list archives](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=87d42l7fka.fsf%40trurl.pps.jussieu.fr&forum_name=polipo-users).

*Why Chris?*

Chrisd was a 2009 Google Summer of Code for Tor/EFF. His project was [Polipo Portability Enhancements](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/polipo-portability-enhancements-summary). Chris has proven himself to be a very competent coder and able to design and implement features as needed. He even wrote a SOCKS layer fix for Firefox bugs, [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=280661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661 "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661").

*What does this mean to Tor?*

It means we have a fantastic new coder maintaining the polipo codebase. Bugfixes, features, and more frequent releases should help improve polipo beyond where it is today.
