Over the past few months, a number of exit relay operators have contacted us asking for help with some legal issues encountered while running their relay. While we can't provide legal advice in all jurisdictions, we can frequently find you a next hop in the legal chain to get you the advice or representation you need. Sometimes this advice is free/pro-bono, other times it is not. It's up to the legal organization to decide if they can take your case or refer you to someone else.

Rather than keep a secret list of people willing to help, we're building a public list for operators to contact directly, in their own country. A big thanks to Fred and Gwen at the EFF for helping to start this list and for making introductions. And, of course, a big thanks to the organizations for agreeing to be listed and for offering support to Tor relay operators.

If you'd like to add your name to this list, please let me know.

The current list of legal support organizations by country is:
