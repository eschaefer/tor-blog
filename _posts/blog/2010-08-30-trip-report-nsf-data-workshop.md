On Friday (Aug 27), I attended the "Workshop on Cyber Security Data for Experimentation" organized by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The premise of the [workshop](http://www.gtisc.gatech.edu/nsf_workshop10_agenda.html) was that many academics need real-world data sets to solve problems, whereas industry is the place with the real-world data sets and they don't have any real reason to share. By getting the academics and the industry people talking, with government funders nearby, they hoped to better understand the problems and maybe move things forward.

I was there (and on the first panel) because of Tor's work on [gathering Tor network snapshots, performance data, and user statistics](https://metrics.torproject.org/). Tor's approach represents one way out of the trap where researchers never quite get the data they want, or if they do it isn't open enough (which hinders whether anybody else can reproduce their results).
