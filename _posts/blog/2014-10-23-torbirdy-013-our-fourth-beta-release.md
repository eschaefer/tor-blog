We offer two ways of installing TorBirdy -- either by visiting our [website](https://dist.torproject.org/torbirdy/torbirdy-0.1.3.xpi) ([sig](https://dist.torproject.org/torbirdy/torbirdy-0.1.3.xpi.asc)) or by visiting the [Mozilla Add-ons page for TorBirdy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/). Please note that there may be a delay -- which can range from a few hours to days -- before the extension is reviewed by Mozilla and updated on the Add-ons page.

As a general anonymity and security note: we are still working on [two known anonymity issues](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#InfoLeaks) with Mozilla. Please make sure that you read the [Before Using TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#BeforeusingTorBirdy) and [Known TorBirdy Issues](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#KnownTorBirdyIssues) sections on the wiki before using TorBirdy.

We had love help with getting our patches accepted, or anything that you think will help improve TorBirdy!
