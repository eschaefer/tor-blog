Hello everybody,

I'm happy to announce a new version for Vidalia, 0.2.15.

If you find any bugs or have ideas on how to improve Vidalia, please  
remember to go to [https://trac.torproject.org/](https://trac.torproject.org/ "https://trac.torproject.org/") and file a ticket for it!

You can find the source tarball and its signature in here:  
 [https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz "https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz")  
 [https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz.asc](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz.asc "https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/vidalia-0.2.15.tar.gz.asc")

TBB and other packages are going to be here soon, please be patient.

Here's what changed:

**0.2.15 07-Oct-2011**

- Draw the bandwidth graph curves based on the local maximum, not  
 the global maximum. Fixes bug 2188.
- Add an option for setting up a non-exit relay to the Sharing  
 configuration panel. This is meant to clarify what an exit policy  
 and an exit relay are. Resolves bug 2644.
- Display time statistics for bridges in UTC time, rather than local  
 time. Fixes bug 3342.
- Change the parameter for ordering the entries in the Basic Log  
 list from currentTime to currentDateTime to avoid missplacing  
 entries from different days.
- Check the tor version and that settings are sanitized before  
 trying to use the port autoconfiguration feature. Fixes bug 3843.
- Provide a way to hide Dock or System Tray icons in OSX. Resolves  
 ticket 2163.
- Make new processes appear at front when they are started (OSX  
 specific).
