The Tor Browser Bundles have been updated to Vidalia 0.2.15. The OS X and Linux bundles have Torbutton 1.4.4, but a hotfix for Windows was released with 1.4.4.1 because 1.4.4 had a minor issue that prevented the Windows bundle from going to [https://check.torproject.org](https://check.torproject.org "https://check.torproject.org").
