The Berkman Center has released their report on the [landscape of circumvention technologies](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/2007_Circumvention_Landscape_Report) as it was in 2007. Tor was included in this test and comes out as a secure tool with some improvements needed. Technology Review also picked up this report and [wrote an article](http://www.technologyreview.com/web/22252/page1/) on the results.

Since the original publication of the report, we've responded to and improved a number of identified weaknesses. The main focus has been on usability of the software. Tor is easier to understand, configure, and install. We've worked on finding translators for the various parts of the suite of tools that comprise Tor. We developed and enhanced a Firefox plugin called Torbutton. The current Torbutton mitigates all known browser-based anonymity attacks. Torbutton is included in our bundles and is automatically installed into the user's Firefox browser configuration. Torbutton can be found at [https://torproject.org/torbutton/](https://torproject.org/torbutton/ "https://torproject.org/torbutton/") or [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275 "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275").
