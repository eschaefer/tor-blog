I was asked to give a five minute speech to open a panel in front of a number of policy makers and advisors in Washington, DC in the past few weeks. The discussion was under [Chatham House Rule](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule). A number of people have encouraged me to publish the speech notes as a blog post, it is as follows.

> Here I am, a technologist in a room full of policy people. I'll stick
> to what I know and try not to put anyone to sleep in the next five
> minutes.
>
> Technology is agnostic, who uses and how they use it matters. Roads,
> cars, phones, email, websites are all technologies used for good and bad.
> In the 1930s, the feds and police warned of mass chaos if the interstate
> highway system was built in the US. The ability for criminals to quickly
> transit between cities was of grave concern. Crime would spread faster,
> further, and this would hasten the breakdown of the very fabric of the
> American society, community. Time has shown the benefits vastly outweighed
> the costs. This same principle has shown to be true of the internet
> and computer technology. Sure, we may have new kinds of crime with botnets,
> zombies, phishing, but do we really? Lying, impersonation, and tricking
> someone into doing your work are the same crimes they have been for the
> past few millenia. It's just that the substrate that is used, has changed.
> What are some of the largest companies in the world? GE, IBM, Apple,
> Microsoft, Google. What one should or should not do is policy and law,
> what one can actually do or not do is technology.
>
> Circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools used in a free world can be
> a minor annoyance, i.e. wikileaks used wikis, ssl, email, and yes, tor,
> but in the end, it's an annoyance. We don't have people in the streets
> rioting trying to overthrow our govt. Wikipedia uses the same technology
> in wikis, ssl, and email. Everyone loves Wikipedia and considers it a net positive.
>
> The same circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools are deadly to
> repressive regimes. The free flow of information and education are of
> great concern to a regime trying to control the horizontal and vertical
> of every day life. The tactics a regime can use are legal, technical,
> and physical. The regime can switch between tactics, generally
> depending upon what's economical and most effective.
>
> Roughly 1 billion people are online in some way. Berkman did a study
> that found roughly 2% of that billion know what a proxy is, or even that
> technology exists to circumvent internet censorship. 98% of the world
> accepts that facebook, google, cnn, and the bbc, are blocked and doesn't
> try to find ways around it. This doesn't even broach the topic of online
> privacy relating to commercial entities nor law enforcement and
> intelligence agencies trying to learn the who, what, where, and how of your Internet activities.
>
> Arguing about which proxy technology should get all of the funding and
> attention is silly. The budgets and adversaries vastly outweigh the
> funding and research into proxies. It's not a zero-sum game, and
> the different technologies take very different approaches to success;
> freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, psiphon, and web proxies play a game of cat
> and mouse with ip addresses and sometimes encryption; tor uses the
> strategy of R&D and protecting ones anonymity and privacy first, the
> secondary effects of this are well-suited to circumvention too. Tor,
> freegate, psiphon, and vpns sum up to roughly $50m in funding from the US govt
> of the past few years. Only a very small fraction of that total has made it to actual technology. Compare that to the billions spent on snakeoil
> black box technology by the DoD and intelligence agencies preparing for
> a cyberwar arms race, much like the nuclear arms race, to deter other
> nations from attacking us.
>
> I talked to a member of a terrorist organization in Vietnam. He's been
> stalked, harassed, and had everything confiscated multiple times by his
> government. You know his organization as Deutsche Welle. He's a
> reporter. He had no idea how his plans, documents, and contacts were
> being discovered and used against him. His ability to understand the
> differences between Tor, JAP, and Freegate was like asking which tires
> are best for gravel, snow, or tarmac. The question he didn't even know
> to ask is, "What are safe and secure computing and online practices?"
> to use my analogy, "what car do I want for those tires? the answer is
> a rally car." I spent 4 hours going over how the internet works,
> how to think about adversaries online, what is ssl, what it means, what
> are phishing, viruses, botnets, and state-sponsored malware. By the
> end of the 4th hour, he understood how tor is different than a simple
> vpn or proxy server, and when to use tor and when it isn't needed. 3.5h
> of that discussion was basic operational, computer, and online security
> and safe practices.
>
> So where does this leave us? It leaves us with a mix of education,
> technology, and many, many unanswered questions. This is a young field
> overall. As the censorship providers and technologies get better, so
> will those circumvention technologies. Educating users about internet
> safety, risks, and making the tools vastly easier and safer to use
> should be a goal.
>
> Tor published a "10 things to think about circumvention tools" paper to
> try to distill what we've learned over the past 10 years of doing this.
> In a few of these areas, tor is not the best choice, for now.
>
> What about technology? Isn't it going to save us all? Currently,
> freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, and web proxies are looking for money to fund
> their growing infrastructure costs. The more users you have, the more
> servers, more bandwidth, and more costs you incur. Its a quick way to
> spend lots of money and get lots of users. However becoming the ISP for
> the world gets very expensive, very quickly as you scale up to hundreds
> of millions of users. Look at the infrastructures of google, facebook,
> yahoo, and microsoft to see the challenges that lie ahead for these tools.
>
> Tor and "distributed tools" look to improve the research and development
> and rely on the scaling of users to both provide the circumvention and
> grow to become a self-sustaining ISP to the world. We have only begun
> to see the power and effects of these technologies with bittorrent, jap,
> skype, freenet, i2p, and tor.
