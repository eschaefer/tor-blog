**Releases**  
 Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha (released December 8) fixes some crash bugs in earlier alpha releases, builds better on unusual platforms like Solaris and old OS X, and fixes a variety of other issues.

Tor Browser Bundle 1.1.6 (released December 2) and 1.1.7 (released December 12) update Tor to 0.2.1.8-alpha, include a new version of Firefox, and attempt to wrestle with the "AllowMultipleInstances=false" design that could allow us to run Tor Browser Bundle alongside a normal Firefox.
