**Updated 06/30/2010**: Mention Reduced Exit Policy, ISP Shopping Tips, and Abuse Response Templates

**Updated 08/30/2010**: Update exit policy with svn, git, hg, Kerberos, remote admin panels, IRC, others

**Updated 01/12/2011**: Suggest creation of LLC for large exit nodes, provide links to ARIN forms and process.  
   

I have noticed that a lot of new exit nodes have recently appeared on the network. This is great news, since exit nodes are typically on the scarce side. Exits usually occupy 30-33% of network by capacity, but are currently at a whopping 38.5% (156 MBytes/sec out of 404 total).

However, I want to make sure that these nodes stay up and don't end up being shut down due to easily preventable abuse complaints. I've run a number of exit nodes on a few different ISPs and not only have I lived to tell about it, I've have not had one shut down yet. Moreover, I've only received about 4 abuse complaints in as many years of running exit nodes. This is in stark contrast to other node operators following a [more reactive strategy](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator). I'm convinced this is largely because I observe the following pro-active guidelines. This guide is primarily US centric. Operators in other countries may have slightly different best practices (such as registering with RIPE and not ARIN).
