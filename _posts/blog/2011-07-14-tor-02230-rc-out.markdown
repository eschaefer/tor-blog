**Changes in version 0.2.2.30-rc - 2011-07-07**  
**Minor bugfixes:**

- Send a SUCCEEDED stream event to the controller when a reverse  
resolve succeeded. Fixes bug 3536; bugfix on 0.0.8pre1. Issue  
discovered by katmagic.
- Always NUL-terminate the sun\_path field of a sockaddr\_un before  
passing it to the kernel. (Not a security issue: kernels are  
smart enough to reject bad sockaddr\_uns.) Found by Coverity;  
CID #428. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.3-alpha.
- Don't stack-allocate the list of supplementary GIDs when we're  
about to log them. Stack-allocating NGROUPS\_MAX gid\_t elements  
could take up to 256K, which is way too much stack. Found by  
Coverity; CID #450. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.
- Add BUILDTIMEOUT\_SET to the list returned by the 'GETINFO  
events/names' control-port command. Bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha;  
fixes part of bug 3465.
- Fix a memory leak when receiving a descriptor for a hidden  
service we didn't ask for. Found by Coverity; CID #30. Bugfix  
on 0.2.2.26-beta.

**Minor features:**

- Update to the July 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
