Your job would be to work on Torbutton and patches to our Firefox-based browser, as well as a potential Android port. This would be a contractor position likely starting in October and going through Q1 2013, with the possibility of later in 2013 and beyond. There may also be a possibility for part-time work prior to October.

The purpose of our browser is to build a private-by-design reference implementation of "Do Not Track", but through the [alteration of browser behavior](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy) and without the need for [regulation or begging](<br%20/>%0Ahttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-private-browsing-modes-do-not-track-vs-real-privacy-design).

Your job will include triaging, diagnosing, and fixing bugs; looking for and resolving web privacy issues; responding on short notice to security issues; and working collaboratively with coworkers and volunteers on implementing new features and web behavior changes.

We'd also need help making our code more maintainable, testable, and mergeable by upstream. Sometimes, we need to drop everything and scramble to implement last-minute fixes, or to deploy urgent security updates. You'd also be reviewing other people's code, designs, and academic research papers, and looking for ways to improve upon them.

See the [job posting](https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html.en) for information on how to apply and what you need to send in with your application.

For an even more detailed overview of the full breadth and depth of the work you'd be doing, have a look at [The Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/), especially [The Design Requirements](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#DesignRequirements) section.
