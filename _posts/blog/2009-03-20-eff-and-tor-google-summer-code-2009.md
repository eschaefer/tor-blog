Great news! We have been accepted as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2009](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009) together with [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/). Yay!

This will be our third Google Summer of Code after 2007 and [2008](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-google-summer-code-2008%21). In our [first year](http://code.google.com/soc/2007/eff/about.html) we had four students working on making relays work better (and not crash) on Windows, on a library and tool to try alternative path selection algorithms, on a fuzzing library to look for parsing problems, and on scalability and privacy for hidden services. In our [second year](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/eff/about.html) we had seven students. One of our successful students of the 2008 program wrote a nice [blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-summer-code-2008-review) reviewing how GSoC went for him, for the other students, and for the project in general.
