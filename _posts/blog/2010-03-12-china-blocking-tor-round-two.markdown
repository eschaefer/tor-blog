Experts in China tell us Tor is not being singled out, that all "circumvention" tools are being subjected to the censorship regime of the Great Firewall of China as politically sensitive anniversaries come about. We also hear people in China need [their privacy too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flesh_search_engine), even if they never leave the Chinese Internet.

However, it appears China is getting better at blocking Tor. Here's a graph of returning users to the Tor Network from China:

However, most Tor users in China switched to non-public relays, called bridges, over the past few months. Interestingly, the GFW has also started blocking some of the more popular bridges:

All of this data, and more, are available at [http://metrics.torproject.org/](http://metrics.torproject.org/ "http://metrics.torproject.org/").

Run a [bridge](https://www.torproject.org/bridges), help someone else get to their favorite websites and forums.
