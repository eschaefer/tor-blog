The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more people who run Tor as a bridge or a relay, the faster and safer the network becomes. [Tactical Tech](https://www.tacticaltech.org/) created a video to encourage you to join the Tor Network. The video, and information about how you can set up a bridge or a relay, can be found on [https://www.torproject.org/relays](https://www.torproject.org/relays). If you want to help us translate the video into your language, let us know!
