On April 24, 2014 Paypal notified us our account was being limited due to potentially fraudulent donations. According to Paypal, donors were claiming chargebacks to their credit card companies for fraudulent donations or purchases. We solely use Paypal to receive donations and therefore rely on Paypal's systems of validation and fraud detection. As a result of the limitations, a number of donors were denied the ability to donate. We appreciate your donations. As of April 30, the limits on our account have been lifted. Please consider a [donation today](https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en).

We received around \$67,000 from 4,700 individuals donating through Paypal in 2013. These donations are used to keep Tor running and developers improving Tor.
