**New Releases** [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/november-2010-progress-report)

On November 16 we released the latest in the Tor -alpha series. Tor 0.2.2.18-alpha fixes several crash bugs that have been nagging us lately, makes unpublished bridge relays able to detect their IP address, and fixes a wide variety of other bugs to get us much closer to a stable release.

On November 23, we released the latest in the Tor -stable series. Tor 0.2.1.27 makes relays work with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and 1.0.0.b --yet another OpenSSL security patch broke its compatibility with Tor. We also took this opportunity to fix several crash bugs, integrate a new directory authority, and update the bundled GeoIP database.
