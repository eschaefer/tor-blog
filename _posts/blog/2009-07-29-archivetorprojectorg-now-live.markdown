By popular request, we've created [http://archive.torproject.org/](http://archive.torproject.org/ "http://archive.torproject.org/"). It serves as an archive of all released versions of Tor since 2004. And as a repository of all relay descriptors and directory authority consensus files published since 2004.

This is the place to get current and past releases of:

- the Tor source code,
- Vidalia itself,
- vidalia bundles for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X,
- our various rpm packages,
- the Tor Browser Bundle and Tor IM Browser Bundle,
- TorVM,
- published consensus files,
- published server descriptors,
- and, other Tor network related files like extra-info and statuses.

The files are offered via [http://archive.torproject.org/](http://archive.torproject.org/ "http://archive.torproject.org/"), rsync (archive.torproject.org::), and hidden service, [http://7ofilo7lqgiub36u.onion](http://7ofilo7lqgiub36u.onion "http://7ofilo7lqgiub36u.onion").

The package archive is around 20GB. The directory authority archive is around 23GB. We'll soon be listing mirrors of this site as well.

Enjoy.
