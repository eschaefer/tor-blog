We've published our [three-year development roadmap](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf). There are two main goals in publishing this document: first to be more transparent in what we're doing; and second to ask for help in improving everything related to Tor.

While we don't expect everyone will read through the roadmap start to finish, the Table of Contents provides a quick overview of the high-level goals. Each high-level goal is fairly independent of another, so you can simply read about the goals that interest you.

And for the first time ever, we've created a [press release](https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release.html.en). This is our attempt to become more press friendly and provide a way for the media to start a conversation with us.

We welcome your comments and feedback!
