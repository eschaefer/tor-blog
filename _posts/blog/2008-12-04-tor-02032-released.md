Tor 0.2.0.32 fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages  
 (and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller  
 security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services,  
 further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of  
 other issues.

Changes in version 0.2.0.32 - 2008-11-20  
 Security fixes:

The "User" and "Group" config options did not clear the  
 supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The "User" option  
 is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified  
 user's primary group. The "Group" option is now ignored. For more  
 detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL\_LOG\_LEVEL  
 in common/compat.c to LOG\_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum  
 and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848 and 857.
