Throughout the summer I've been working on a project called 'arm' (which stands for the 'anonymizing relay monitor'). It's a real-time, terminal monitor for Tor relays providing bandwidth/cpu/memory usage, relay configuration, event log, connections, and other details relay operators might find handy for checking Tor's status. The project's intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone stuck with a tty terminal.

Source, screen shots, and a development log are available on the [project's page](http://www.atagar.com/arm) and an interview by Brenno Winter discussing the project is available [here](http://www.atagar.com/arm/HFM_INT_0001.mp3).
