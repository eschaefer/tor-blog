Tor 0.2.1.15-rc marks the second release candidate for the 0.2.1.x  
series. It fixes a major bug on fast exit relays, as well as a variety  
of more minor bugs.

This is a release candidate! That means that we don't know of any  
remaining show-stopping bugs, and this will become the new stable if  
there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems  
that you find.

Changes in version 0.2.1.15-rc - 2009-05-25

**Major bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x):** - Fix a timing-dependent, allocator-dependent, DNS-related crash bug that would occur on some exit nodes when DNS failures and timeouts occurred in certain patterns. Fix for bug 957.

**Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.0.x):** - Actually return -1 in the error case for read\_bandwidth\_usage().  
 Harmless bug, since we currently don't care about the return value  
 anywhere. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
- Provide a more useful log message if bug 977 (related to buffer  
 freelists) ever reappears, and do not crash right away.
- Fix an assertion failure on 64-bit platforms when we allocated  
 memory right up to the end of a memarea, then realigned the memory  
 one step beyond the end. Fixes a possible cause of bug 930.
- Protect the count of open sockets with a mutex, so we can't  
 corrupt it when two threads are closing or opening sockets at once.  
 Fix for bug 939. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
- Don't allow a bridge to publish its router descriptor to a  
 non-bridge directory authority. Fixes part of bug 932.
- When we change to or from being a bridge, reset our counts of  
 client usage by country. Fixes bug 932.
- Fix a bug that made stream bandwidth get misreported to the  
 controller.
- Stop using malloc\_usable\_size() to use more area than we had  
 actually allocated: it was safe, but made valgrind really unhappy.
- Fix a memory leak when v3 directory authorities load their keys  
 and cert from disk. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.

**Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x):** - Fix use of freed memory when deciding to mark a non-addable  
 descriptor as never-downloadable. Bugfix on 0.2.1.9-alpha.
