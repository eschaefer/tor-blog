**Known issues**

- The Unsafe Browser cannot connect to the Internet ( [ticket #6479](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6479)). This can be workaround"ed by setting `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `false` on the about:config web page.
- Keyboard shortcuts use QWERTY mapping instead of AZERTY on French keyboard ( [ticket #6478](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6478)). This may impact other keyboard layouts as well.
- TorBrowser takes too long to shutdown ( [ticket #6480](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6480)).
- TorBrowser proposes to share the microphone with websites ( [ticket #6481](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6481)).
- htpdate uses a different User-Agent than the Tor Browser ( [ticket #6477](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6477)).
- The included Linux 3.10-3 (version 3.10.11-1) kernel has a few known security issues.
- [Longstanding](https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/) known issues.
