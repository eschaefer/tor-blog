Introducing a new monthly progress report format. Since June 2008, I've been posting the monthly reports we write for our sponsors as blog posts. The goal is to share with you, our community, what we do every month in an easy to understand, summarized way.

Over the past year, I've had a few requests to make these monthly progress reports into a file format people can take with them for reading offline. For all of 2011, I'm going to be attaching a PDF file (generated by LaTeX) to the reports.

I've gone back to [January 2011](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/january-2011-progress-report) and [February 2011](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/february-2011-progress-report) and attached the files to each post, respectively.

The PDF includes graphs and is generally much easier to read than printing the blog post to a PDF file.

The March 2011 Progress Report is attached to this post.
