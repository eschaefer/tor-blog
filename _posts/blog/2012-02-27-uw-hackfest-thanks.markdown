Thanks to the 30+ people that showed up across [our hackfests](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/university-washington-open-hackfest) on Wednesday and Thursday. We talked about [obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en), [torouter](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter), civil liberties and tor, and Andrew spent four-plus hours explaining tor, hidden services, and online privacy risks to a bunch of tor-curious people. It's clear the ice cream sundae/gourmet popcorn bar was a huge success, with people literally squealing their love for Tor (I'm sure it was tor and not the ice cream ;). Thanks to [PrivateOnion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=288BaXwK8dY) for writing a song. [@INTLRevolver](https://twitter.com/#!/INTLRevolver) started a twibbon campaign and shared some womens' privacy issues with us and how Tor can help.

And a final thank you to Mel and Kar at the U of Washington for their support, logistics, and general awesomeness overall.
