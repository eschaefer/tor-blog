The Tor Browser Bundles for Linux have all been updated to really include the latest Firefox, 10.0.2.

[https://www.torproject.org/download](https://www.torproject.org/download "https://www.torproject.org/download")

**Tor Browser Bundle for Linux (2.2.35-7.2)**

-   Really update Firefox to 10.0.2
-   Update libpng to 1.5.9

Please note that this time around, I made and signed the bundles as Erinn is travelling. I hope all the previous issues have been fixed, and would like to apologize for taking so long to get updated Linux bundles out. Please report any issues you find on our [bugtracker](https://trac.torproject.org).

You can find my gpg key's fingerprint on the [signing keys](https://www.torproject.org/docs/signing-keys.html.en) page.
