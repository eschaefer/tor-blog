Tor 0.2.0.32 fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages
(and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller
security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services,
further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of
other issues.

Changes in version 0.2.0.32 - 2008-11-20
Security fixes:

- The "User" and "Group" config options did not clear the
 supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The "User" option
 is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified
 user's primary group. The "Group" option is now ignored. For more
 detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL\_LOG\_LEVEL
 in common/compat.c to LOG\_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum
 and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848 and 857.
- The "ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses" config option wasn't being
 consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its
 exit policy doesn't allow it, we would remember what IP address
 the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it's
 an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.

Major bugfixes:

- Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process
 at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.

Major bugfixes (hidden services):

- When fetching v0 and v2 rendezvous service descriptors in parallel,
 we were failing the whole hidden service request when the v0
 descriptor fetch fails, even if the v2 fetch is still pending and
 might succeed. Similarly, if the last v2 fetch fails, we were
 failing the whole hidden service request even if a v0 fetch is
 still pending. Fixes bug 814. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
- When extending a circuit to a hidden service directory to upload a
 rendezvous descriptor using a BEGIN\_DIR cell, almost 1/6 of all
 requests failed, because the router descriptor has not been
 downloaded yet. In these cases, do not attempt to upload the
 rendezvous descriptor, but wait until the router descriptor is
 downloaded and retry. Likewise, do not attempt to fetch a rendezvous
 descriptor from a hidden service directory for which the router
 descriptor has not yet been downloaded. Fixes bug 767. Bugfix
 on 0.2.0.10-alpha.

Minor bugfixes:

- Fix several infrequent memory leaks spotted by Coverity.
- When testing for libevent functions, set the LDFLAGS variable
 correctly. Found by Riastradh.
- Avoid a bug where the FastFirstHopPK 0 option would keep Tor from
 bootstrapping with tunneled directory connections. Bugfix on
 0.1.2.5-alpha. Fixes bug 797. Found by Erwin Lam.
- When asked to connect to A.B.exit:80, if we don't know the IP for A
 and we know that server B rejects most-but-not all connections to
 port 80, we would previously reject the connection. Now, we assume
 the user knows what they were asking for. Fixes bug 752. Bugfix
 on 0.0.9rc5. Diagnosed by BarkerJr.
- If we overrun our per-second write limits a little, count this as
 having used up our write allocation for the second, and choke
 outgoing directory writes. Previously, we had only counted this when
 we had met our limits precisely. Fixes bug 824. Patch from by rovv.
 Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.
- Remove the old v2 directory authority 'lefkada' from the default
 list. It has been gone for many months.
- Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on
 sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fixes bug 862.
- Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on
 0.1.2.8-beta.

Minor bugfixes (controller):

- Make DNS resolved events into "CLOSED", not "FAILED". Bugfix on
 0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves bug 807.
