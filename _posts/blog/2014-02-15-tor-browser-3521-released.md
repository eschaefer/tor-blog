The 3.5.2.1 release of the Tor Browser Bundle is now available on the [Download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html). You can also download the bundles directly from the [distribution directory](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.5.2.1/).

This release fixes the localization of the non-english bundles.
