We are happy to announce the launch of the [Tor Farsi blog](https://fa-blog.torproject.org/). The site is created in response to the great reception of Tor and circumvention tools amongst Iranian users. The goal of this site is to be a one-stop place to find Tor related material in Farsi.

The Farsi team will translate white papers, summaries of select posts, and important updates relevant to Tor. We want to create a community of Farsi-speaking Tor users and empower them with information about anonymity and privacy on the Internet. We hope this community will spread this information to others to help them with their Internet anonymity and privacy needs.
