Thanks to everyone for attending today. We had some great discussions about [The Haven Project](http://www.haven-project.org/), Economic Association for tor relay operators, [telecomix](http://www.telecomix.org/), pluggable transports, [TAILS](http://tails.boum.org/), IPv6, [sandboxing flash](http://romab.se/), and of course, tor itself.

And a great bit of gratitude to iis.se for promoting and hosting the hackfest, and for providing food.
