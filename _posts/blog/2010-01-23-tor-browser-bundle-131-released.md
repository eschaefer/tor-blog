The latest in the Tor Browser series, version 1.3.1 is released. This includes updates to Firefox, Pidgin, and Tor.

Tor 0.2.1.22 rotates two of the seven v3 directory authority keys and  
 locations, due to a security breach of some of the Torproject servers:

It also fixes a privacy problem in bridge directory authorities -- it  
 would tell you its whole history of bridge descriptors if you make the  
 right directory request.

Everybody should upgrade:
