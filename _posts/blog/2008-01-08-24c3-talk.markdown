I'm back from the [24C3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/) congress in Berlin. My [talk](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2007/Fahrplan/events/2325.en.html) went well ( [video](http://berlin.ccc.de/~24c3_torrents/24c3-2325-en-current_events_in_tor_development.mp4.torrent), [slides](http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-24c3.pdf)).

Basically I gave an overview of some of the big technical things we did in 2007, some of the policy/legal issues that we're tackling, and some of the technical things that need to come next. The focus was on Germany, so it included some discussion of the upcoming data retention problems, and of the general issue with police in Germany seizing servers.
