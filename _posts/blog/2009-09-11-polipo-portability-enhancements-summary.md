Over the summer for GSoC 2009, I worked on Polipo, Tor's favored Web proxy for bridging the gap between HTTP and SOCKS protocols. The proxy also provides an efficient memory cache to help speed up browsing. I had an opportunity to learn about Polipo and Libevent, and I had a chance to attend [PETS](http://petsymposium.org/2009/), a privacy conference, and meet some of the Tor folks in person. [Polipo](http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/) is authored by Juliusz Chroboczek. [Libevent](http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/) is developed by Nick Mathewson and Niels Provos.
