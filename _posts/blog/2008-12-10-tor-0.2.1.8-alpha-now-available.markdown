Tor 0.2.1.8-alpha fixes some crash bugs in earlier alpha releases,
builds better on unusual platforms like Solaris and old OS X, and fixes
a variety of other issues.

Changes in version 0.2.1.8-alpha - 2008-12-08
**Major features:**

- New DirPortFrontPage option that takes an html file and publishes
 it as "/" on the DirPort. Now relay operators can provide a
 disclaimer without needing to set up a separate webserver. There's
 a sample disclaimer in contrib/tor-exit-notice.html.

**Security fixes:**

- When the client is choosing entry guards, now it selects at most
 one guard from a given relay family. Otherwise we could end up with
 all of our entry points into the network run by the same operator.
 Suggested by Camilo Viecco. Fix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.

**Major bugfixes:**

- Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process
 at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.
- Fix a possible segfault when establishing an exit connection. Bugfix
 on 0.2.1.5-alpha.

**Minor bugfixes:**

- Get file locking working on win32. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha. Fixes
 bug 859.
- Made Tor a little less aggressive about deleting expired
 certificates. Partial fix for bug 854.
- Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on
 sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fix for bug 862.
- Fix a crash bug when changing EntryNodes from the controller. Bugfix
 on 0.2.1.6-alpha. Fix for bug 867. Patched by Sebastian.
- Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on
 0.1.2.8-beta.
- If one win32 nameserver fails to get added, continue adding the
 rest, and don't automatically fail.
- Use fcntl() for locking when flock() is not available. Should fix
 compilation on Solaris. Should fix Bug 873. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.
- Do not mark smartlist\_bsearch\_idx() function as ATTR\_PURE. This bug
 could make gcc generate non-functional binary search code. Bugfix
 on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
- Build correctly on platforms without socklen\_t.
- Avoid potential crash on internal error during signature collection.
 Fixes bug 864. Patch from rovv.
- Do not use C's stdio library for writing to log files. This will
 improve logging performance by a minute amount, and will stop
 leaking fds when our disk is full. Fixes bug 861.
- Stop erroneous use of O\_APPEND in cases where we did not in fact
 want to re-seek to the end of a file before every last write().
- Correct handling of possible malformed authority signing key
 certificates with internal signature types. Fixes bug 880. Bugfix
 on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
- Fix a hard-to-trigger resource leak when logging credential status.
 CID 349.

**Minor features:**

- Directory mirrors no longer fetch the v1 directory or
 running-routers files. They are obsolete, and nobody asks for them
 anymore. This is the first step to making v1 authorities obsolete.

**Minor features (controller):**

- Return circuit purposes in response to GETINFO circuit-status. Fixes
 bug 858.
