Tor 0.2.0.31 addresses two potential anonymity issues, starts to fix  
 a big bug we're seeing where in rare cases traffic from one Tor stream  
 gets mixed into another stream, and fixes a variety of smaller issues.

Changes in version 0.2.0.31 - 2008-09-03  
 o Major bugfixes:  
 - Make sure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection  
 with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This  
 is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc.  
 - Relays now reject risky extend cells: if the extend cell includes  
 a digest of all zeroes, or asks to extend back to the relay that  
 sent the extend cell, tear down the circuit. Ideas suggested  
 by rovv.  
 - If not enough of our entry guards are available so we add a new  
 one, we might use the new one even if it overlapped with the  
 current circuit's exit relay (or its family). Anonymity bugfix  
 pointed out by rovv.

o Minor bugfixes:  
 - Recover 3-7 bytes that were wasted per memory chunk. Fixes bug  
 794; bug spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.  
 - Correctly detect the presence of the linux/netfilter\_ipv4.h header  
 when building against recent kernels. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.  
 - Pick size of default geoip filename string correctly on windows.  
 Fixes bug 806. Bugfix on 0.2.0.30.  
 - Make the autoconf script accept the obsolete --with-ssl-dir  
 option as an alias for the actually-working --with-openssl-dir  
 option. Fix the help documentation to recommend --with-openssl-dir.  
 Based on a patch by "Dave". Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.  
 - Disallow session resumption attempts during the renegotiation  
 stage of the v2 handshake protocol. Clients should never be trying [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0.2.0.31-released)
