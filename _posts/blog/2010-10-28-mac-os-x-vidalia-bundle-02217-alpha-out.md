Vidalia 0.2.10 changed the way we deal with the [geoip databases by dropping the remote geoip lookups](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/vidalia-0210-released). This caused a lot of headaches for OS X users because of the layout of the package, but it's fixed in this version. You can download the new version [here](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia-bundles/).

Please let us know if you have further problems by [reporting a bug](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor).
