Tor 0.2.1.17-rc marks the fourth -- and hopefully last -- release  
 candidate for the 0.2.1.x series. It lays the groundwork for further  
 client performance improvements, and also fixes a big bug with directory  
 authorities that were causing them to assign Guard and Stable flags  
 poorly.

The Windows bundles also finally include the geoip database that we  
 thought we'd been shipping since 0.2.0.x (oops), and the OS X bundles  
 should actually install Torbutton rather than giving you a cryptic  
 failure message (oops).

This is a release candidate! That means that we don't know of any  
 remaining show-stopping bugs, and 0.2.1.18 will be the new stable if  
 there are no problems. Please test it, and tell us about any problems  
 that you find.
