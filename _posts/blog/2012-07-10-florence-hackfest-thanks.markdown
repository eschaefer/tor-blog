Thanks to all who attended and helped make the hackfest in Florence a success. Around 50 people stayed for the two day event. We heard from a team working on a free hardware and software (firmware to drivers) laptop prototype, some [Italian legal experts](http://www.studiogallus.it/) with regards to anonymity, encryption, and chilling effects used to great length in the country, plus a number of Italian hackers from [EuroPython 2012](https://ep2012.europython.eu/) interested in Tor (and vice versa).

And a big thanks to the [Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze](http://www.unifi.it/), [Il Progetto Winston Smith](http://www.winstonsmith.org/) and Arturo for their translations, coordinations, and general welcoming attitude to Italy.
