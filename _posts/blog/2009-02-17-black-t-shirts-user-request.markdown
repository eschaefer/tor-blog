Our fine green t-shirts have been a hit over the past few years. By the sheer number of requests we've received for another color, it appears not everyone is comfortable wearing the [conversation starting green](https://www.torproject.org/tshirt/green-tor-tshirt.png). We now have black t-shirts. Just like the green shirts, these are Fruit of the Loom "tagless" 100% cotton t-shirts. They have the Tor logo and domain name on the front, nothing on the back.

The conditions for receiving them are still the same:

1. A large enough ($65+) [donation](https://torproject.org/donate.html.en) to the Tor Project.
2. Operate a fast [Tor relay](https://torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en) that's been running for the past two months: you are eligible if you allow exits to port 80 and you average 100 KB/s traffic, or if you're not an exit but you average 500 KB/s traffic.
3. Help out in [other ways](https://torproject.org/volunteer.html.en). [Maintain a translation for the website](https://torproject.org/translation.html.en). Write a good [support program and get a lot of people to use it](https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/SupportPrograms). Do research on Tor and anonymity, solve some of [our bugs](https://bugs.torproject.org/), or establish yourself as a Tor advocate.

The pictures just have the shirts folded in half so you can see the detail.
