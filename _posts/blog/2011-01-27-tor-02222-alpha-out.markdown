Changes in version 0.2.2.22-alpha - 2011-01-25  
**Major bugfixes:**

- Fix a bounds-checking error that could allow an attacker to  
 remotely crash a directory authority. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.  
 Found by "piebeer".
- Don't assert when changing from bridge to relay or vice versa  
 via the controller. The assert happened because we didn't properly  
 initialize our keys in this case. Bugfix on 0.2.2.18-alpha; fixes  
 bug 2433. Reported by bastik.

**Minor features:**

- Adjust our TLS Diffie-Hellman parameters to match those used by  
 Apache's mod\_ssl.
- Provide a log message stating which geoip file we're parsing  
 instead of just stating that we're parsing the geoip file.  
 Implements ticket 2432.

**Minor bugfixes:**

- Check for and reject overly long directory certificates and  
 directory tokens before they have a chance to hit any assertions.  
 Bugfix on 0.2.1.28 / 0.2.2.20-alpha. Found by "doorss".
