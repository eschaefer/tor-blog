Today we are happy to [release our first beta](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-February/027277.html) of [TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy). It has been in development since April of last year and was released internally on the tor-talk mailing list. We think we've had just over five thousand users testing it in the last year. We have polished it and we've made great progress.

What is [TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy)?

[TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy) is a Torbutton like extension for Thunderbird, Icedove and related Mozilla mail clients. It may also work with other non-web browser Mozilla programs such as Sunbird. We've also added support for JonDo, Whonix, Tails; if that means something to you, let us know how it works!

We offer two ways to install TorBirdy - either by visiting [our website](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbirdy/torbirdy-0.1.0.xpi) ( [sig](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbirdy/torbirdy-0.1.0.xpi.asc)) or by visiting the [Mozilla AddOn page for TorBirdy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/) ( [xpi available here](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/downloads/file/191748/torbirdy-0.1.0-tb.xpi?src=dp-btn-primary)).

As a general Anonymity and security note: We're still working on [two](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6314) [known](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6315) anonymity issues with [Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=776397). When our improvements to Thunderbird are accepted, it will be anonymity ready out of the box and we'll do a proper full release.

We'd love help with translations, programming or anything that you think will improve TorBirdy!

Thanks to all of our TorBirdy users and contributors - Sukhbir and I would especially like to tagnaq and Karsten N!
