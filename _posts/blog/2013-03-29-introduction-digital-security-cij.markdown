On Monday the 25th of March, the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London organized a free event where journalists could [learn more about digital security](http://www.tcij.org/events/2013-03-25/introduction-digital-security). I was invited to speak about Tor, other speakers covered OTR, TrueCrypt, GPG, and mobile security.

The attendees were divided into five groups, and each speaker had 20-25 minutes with each group. I gave out USB sticks with the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), the [Pluggable Transports Bundle](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy), the [short user manual](https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml), and the [2012 annual report](https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2012-TorProject-Annual-Report.pdf).

I talked a bit about the history of Tor and the Tor Project, discussed a few different threats, mentioned hidden services, listed a few examples of real world use, and helped everyone get the Tor Browser Bundle up and running. I did not have access to a projector or whiteboard, so I did my best to illustrate how Tor works by drawing boxes, arrows, blobs, and stick figures on a piece of paper.

A number of people asked if we had some sort of document or manual explaining all the topics covered at this event. I mentioned [Security in a box](https://securityinabox.org/) and the [FLOSS Manuals](http://flossmanuals.net/), but also pointed out that there is currently no single document available, that I am aware of, which explains all of these topics.

I have previously discussed creating such a document with the [Rory Peck Trust](http://www.rorypecktrust.org/), which is a London based organization that specializes in safety, security and professional development for freelance journalists. I mentioned this again when I met with them the day after the CIJ event, and Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing the end result in a few months.

Thanks to the [Centre for Investigative Journalism](http://tcij.org/) for hosting the event and inviting me.
