Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.2, is out.

This release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.1.2/) and all users must [upgrade](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/) as soon as possible.

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

-   Major new features
    -   Install (most of) the Tor Browser, replacing our previous Iceweasel-based browser. The version installed is from TBB 4.0 and is based on Firefox 31.2.0esr. This fixes the POODLE vulnerability.
    -   Upgrade Tor to 0.2.5.8-rc.
    -   Confine several important applications with AppArmor.
-   Bugfixes
    -   Install Linux 3.16-3 (version 3.16.5-1).
-   Minor improvements
    -   Upgrade I2P to 0.9.15, and isolate I2P traffic from the Tor Browser by adding a dedicated I2P Browser. Also, start I2P automatically upon network connection, when the `i2p` boot option is added.
    -   Make it clear that *TrueCrypt* will be removed in Tails 1.2.1 ([ticket \#7739](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7739)), and document how to open *TrueCrypt* volumes with `cryptsetup`.
    -   Enable VirtualBox guest additions by default ([ticket \#5730](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5730)). In particular this enables VirtualBox's display management service.
    -   Make the OTR status in Pidgin clearer thanks to the formatting toolbar ([ticket \#7356](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7356)).
    -   Upgrade syslinux to 6.03-pre20, which should fix UEFI boot on some hardware.

See the [online Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog) for technical details.

**Known issues**

-   Tor Browser is translated in [15 languages only](https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues#browser_languages).
-   [Longstanding](https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/) known issues.
