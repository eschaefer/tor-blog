Today the EFF and the Tor Project are launching a public beta of a new Firefox extension called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://eff.org/https-everywhere/).

This Firefox extension was inspired by the launch of Google's encrypted search option. We wanted a way to ensure that every search our browsers sent was encrypted, including the search box and URL bar features. At the same time, we were also able to encrypt most or all of the browser's communications with other popular sites that support SSL, but don't provide it by default.

Our approach is based on the [NoScript STS](http://hackademix.net/2009/09/23/strict-transport-security-in-noscript/) implementation, but is more expressive in the manner in which [HTTPS-enforcing rules are written](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets).
