Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.1.2, is out.

This release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.1.1/) and all users must [upgrade](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/) as soon as possible.

We prepared this release mainly to fix a [serious flaw](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/09/24/rsa-signature-forgery-in-nss/) in the Network Security Services (NSS) library used by Firefox and other products allows attackers to create forged RSA certificates.

Before this release, users on a compromised network could be directed to sites using a fraudulent certificate and mistake them for legitimate sites. This could deceive them into revealing personal information such as usernames and passwords. It may also deceive users into downloading malware if they believe itâ€™s coming from a trusted site.

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

-   Security fixes
    -   Upgrade the web browser to 24.8.0esr-0+tails3\~bpo70+1
    -   Install Linux 3.16-1
    -   Numerous other software upgrades that fix security issues: GnuPG, APT, DBus, Bash, and packages built from the bind9 and libav source packages

See the [online Changelog](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/plain/debian/changelog) for technical details.
