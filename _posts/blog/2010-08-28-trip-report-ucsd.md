On Sunday (8/22) through Wednesday (8/25), I visited the Tor research group at [UCSD](http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/) as part of my ongoing plans to help academic research groups [better understand Tor and its research problems](https://www.torproject.org/research). Damon McCoy has a fellowship (postdoc) there for last year and this coming year, and he's brought Kevin Bauer in from UColorado from now until December. They have two systems profs with congestion control background (Stefan Savage and Geoff Voelker) interested in helping them work on Tor and performance.

Kevin is planning to spend the next year on Tor performance work, as the last chapter of his thesis. He's also applied to [Ian Goldberg's postdoc position at Waterloo](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-related-research-positions-university-waterloo). He seems like a smart and dedicated guy; I'd be excited if Ian picks him.

I spent most of my time walking Damon and Kevin through Tor's current congestion control levels -- explaining what Tor does, as well as what I think is actually resulting from each of these components. Kevin has lots of notes, and if all goes well that will seed the core of a "Why else is Tor slow" whitepaper over the coming months, as a sequel to [the original](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow).
