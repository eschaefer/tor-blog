Hi, the next release of arm is now available. This one was focused on a full rewrite of the connection panel, improving its maintainability, performance, and (best of all) features. When rendered, the panel's baseline cpu usage is less than half of its previous incarnation, along with providing far more information...

- Full paths for your currently active Tor circuits  
- Identification of the applications attached to your socks, hidden service, and control ports  
- Identifying exit connections and the common uses for ports they're attached to  
- Much better accuracy in identifying client and directory connections  
- Expanded path information when there's space available (thanks to Fabian Keil)

... and many, many more enhancements and fixes. For the full list see:

Also, thanks to pyllyukko arm is now on slackbuilds.org so there's simple install options available for:  
Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Slackware

As always, screenshots and downloads are available from the project's homepage:
