In February 2011, we enabled IPv6 access to the majority of our websites, such as [www.torproject.org](http://www.torproject.org "www.torproject.org"), trac.torproject.org, archive.torproject.org, media.torproject.org, gitweb.torproject.org, and check.torproject.org. We've seen a growing amount of ipv6 traffic going to www, gitweb, and archive since then.

However, this isn't what people think about, nor want to hear about, when thinking of Tor and IPv6. Nick [posted our efforts](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ipv6-future-i-hear) on this front in late April. There is an opportunity for someone to make a big impact by helping us enable ipv6 in the tor codebase. We're keeping our thoughts in a [draft proposal](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/ideas/xxx-ipv6-plan.txt). We have more thoughts about [supporting IPv6 exits](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/117-ipv6-exits.txt) written down in 2007.

If IPv6 is the [future](http://www.worldipv6day.org/), protecting your privacy online should be part of that future. We're looking for help to make it happen.
