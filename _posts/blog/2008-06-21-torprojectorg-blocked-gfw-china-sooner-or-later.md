We didn't expect Tor wouldn't be blocked in China for a long time before it became true days ago.  We've got a lot of users' reports on that from different regions in China about torproject.org was blocked by [Great Firewall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China) system in China.

> torproject.org is the official Tor(The Onion Router) web site, found recently been blocked by China's national firewall, also known as Great Firewall.  
>  Trace route from Beijing, China shows the destination is unreachable, seems they changed the route table on the router at IP 202.97.66.37, refuse connection to Tor web site.
