We are currently sponsoring a [design contest](http://www.worth1000.com/contest.asp?contest_id=20680) to create a new logo for [Vidalia](http://www.vidalia-project.net). The winner of the contest will receive a $250 USD cash prize. The firm deadline for contest submissions is August 22, 2008.

The logo will be used in the Vidalia software and related installers, on the website, and on t-shirts. Designers are free to choose any fonts, color combinations, and symbol options you like (no onions, though, please). The logo must include a symbolic component that is recognizable by itself without the name "Vidalia" next to it. See the contest page for more details. If you have further questions, please email [contest@vidalia-project.net](mailto:contest@vidalia-project.net) or stop by #vidalia on irc.oftc.net.

Here's the overall timeline for the contest:

- August 15 – August 22: Entries may be submitted at the [Worth1000 contest page](http://www.worth1000.com/contest.asp?contest_id=20680).
- August 23 – August 24: Everyone is welcome to review the submissions received and vote on their favorite design. Even if you didn't submit anything, you can still vote!
- August 25 – August 31: The final winner will be announced by August 31 at the latest.

Late entries will not be eligible for the cash prize, so be sure to get your
submission in by August 22!
