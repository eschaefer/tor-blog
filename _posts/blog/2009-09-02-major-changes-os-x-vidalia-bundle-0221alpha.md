As highlighted in the [0.2.2.1-alpha release notes](http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0221alpha-released), the Vidalia Bundle for OS X includes some major changes. Many of these are for ease of use and user experience improvements. The release of OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) gave me a fine excuse to release the improvements.

It's best to [un-install Tor/Vidalia](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-osx.html.en#uninstall) and then install this new bundle; rather than upgrade. If you want to upgrade, you'll need to update the paths for Tor and Polipo in the Vidalia Settings window.

There has been a lot of testing since this [test release](http://blog.torproject.org/blog/experimental-os-x-drag-and-drop-vidalia-bundle-installer) of the drag and drop installer for OS X in January. The main goal was to make installation far easier, less error prone, and keep all of the bundle in a single directory for easier configuration and un-installation.
