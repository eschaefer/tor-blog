Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.20, is out.

All users must upgrade as soon as possible: this release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.19/).

[Download it now.](https://tails.boum.org/download/)

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

-   New features
    -   Install Linux kernel 3.10.3-1 from Debian unstable.
    -   Iceweasel 17.0.8esr + Torbrowser patches.
-   Bugfixes
    -   Prevent Iceweasel from displaying a warning when leaving HTTPS web sites.
    -   Make Iceweasel use the correct, localized search engine.
    -   Fix Git access to https:// repositories.
-   Minor improvements
    -   Install Dasher, a predictive text entry tool.
    -   Add a wrapper around TrueCrypt which displays a warning about it soon being deprecated in Tails.
    -   Remove Pidgin libraries for all protocols but IRC and Jabber/XMPP. Many of the other protocols Pidgin support are broken in Tails and haven't got any security auditting.
    -   Disable the pre-defined Pidgin accounts so they do not auto-connect on Pidgin start.
    -   Include information about Alsa in WhisperBack reports.
    -   Explicitly restrict access to ptrace. While this setting was enabled by default in Debian's Linux 3.9.6-1, it will later disabled in 3.9.7-1. It's unclear what will happen next, so let's explicitly enable it ourselves.
    -   Do not display dialog when a message is sent in Claws Mail.
    -   Sync iceweasel preferences with the Torbrowser's.
-   Localization
    -   Many translation updates all over the place.
    -   Merge all Tails-related POT files into one, and make use of intltoolize for better integration with Transifex.
