Last year we had [bridge by default](http://blog.torproject.org/blog/technology-preview-bridge-default-microsoft-windows-clients) bundles as a technology preview but we're going to bring them back on a consistent basis. We have an updated [bridge by default Vidalia bundle](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia-bundles/vidalia-bridge-bundle-0.2.2.23-alpha-0.2.10.exe) ( [sig](https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia-bundles/vidalia-bridge-bundle-0.2.2.23-alpha-0.2.10.exe.asc)) for Windows available with [Tor 0.2.2.23-alpha](http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02223-alpha-out). We will soon have OS X bridge by default bundles as well -- you can follow along [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2821) if you're interested in the technical details.

We're very interested in getting feedback about how many new bridges these bundles create, so please comment here or on our [bug tracking system](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor) and let us know.
