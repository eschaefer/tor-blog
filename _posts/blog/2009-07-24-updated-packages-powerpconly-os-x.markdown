Thanks to an anonymous donor for the working powerpc hardware, I was able to make 0.2.0.35, 0.2.1.17-rc, and Vidalia 0.1.15 packages on OS X 10.3.9 (Panther) this evening.

They are available in the usual places, such as [https://torproject.org/download](https://torproject.org/download "https://torproject.org/download")

Thanks for your patience.
