The [3rd USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13)(FOCI '13) has put out a call for papers. Submissions are being encouraged from a wide range of disciplines; both technical and non-technical. Don’t miss out!

The FOCI ’13 program committee is looking for new, interesting works on a wide variety of topics including technically-focused position papers and works-in-progress as well as papers within the social sciences focusing on policy, law, regulation, economics or related fields of study.

Papers must be submitted by May 6, 2013, 11:59 p.m. PDT. For more details on the submission process, please see the complete  [Call for Papers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13/call-for-papers/)

Then mark your calendars and join members of the Tor team at the  
 [3rd USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13) - August 13, 2013 in Washington, D.C  
Co-located with the 22nd USENIX Security Symposium, August 14-16, 2013

NOTE: Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum from Tor are participating on the FOCI '13 program and steering committees, therefore we are helping to promote the call for these papers.
