After over a year it's about time that I announced an arm release so here it is! What's new since [August of 2009](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2009/msg00040.html), you ask? Lots. The project has been under very active development, continuing to add usability improvements to make relay operation nicer and less error prone. If you're really curious what I've been up to this last year then it's all available in the [change log](http://www.atagar.com/arm/log.php).

For those unfamiliar, arm is a terminal monitor for Tor relays and, to a growing extent, end users. It provides:

- resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)
- general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags, or/dir/controlports)
- event log with optional regex filtering and deduplication
- connections correlated against tor's consensus data (ip, connection types, relay details, etc)
- an editor to quickly alter Tor's configuration
- torrc configuration file with syntax highlighting and validation

and quite a bit more via a curses interface. For screenshots and downloads visit:

Peter and I are currently working on getting its debs in shape so hopefully this'll soon be available via repositories for Debian and Ubuntu too. RPM builds are available, though I don't have a test system so beware: there be dragons (possibly).

If there's any python hackers out there interested in dabbling in a bit of Tor UI development, then I'd love to have some company. Suggestions, bug reports and feedback are also be very welcome. Cheers! -Damian
