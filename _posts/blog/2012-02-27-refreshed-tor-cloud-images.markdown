The [Tor Cloud images](https://cloud.torproject.org/) for all the seven regions have been updated to include the latest cloud image for stable Ubuntu release 10.04.4 LTS (Lucid Lynx). These new images are available on the [Tor Cloud website](https://cloud.torproject.org/).

Users who wish to update their existing installations can do so with: _apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade && reboot_.
