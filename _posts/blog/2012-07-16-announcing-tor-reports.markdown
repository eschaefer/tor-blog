For the past four years, I've been summarizing progress of Tor on the blog. See the tag [progress report](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/progress-report) for the history of these reports. Based on community feedback, we're switching to a mailing list with archive of the raw status reports. [Tor-reports](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/) is live. The goal is to provide the raw details rather than summarizing all of the progress and only being able to provide a quick summary per topic.

Each developer, advocate, and internal staff will be posting their reports to this list. The idea is to share more with the community and give people a chance to ask questions directly of the people doing the work. Enjoy the transparency.
