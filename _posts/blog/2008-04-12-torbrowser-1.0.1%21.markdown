Tor Browser Bundle 1.0.0 (released Mar 20) and 1.0.1 (released Mar 26) makes it work correctly with Polipo again, updates the versions of many of its components, and makes it easier to build the Bundle with custom included "jar" (plug-in) files as well as "xpi" (extension) files.

We moved the Tor Browser Bundle website into the main Tor website, so it can re-use our translation infrastructure. Currently its frontpage is available in English, German, Italian, Polish, and Russian.
