Last week I gave an hour-long talk about [flash proxies](https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/).

-   [HTML abstract](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/130220.html)
-   [Video stream](http://ee380.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/videologger.php?target=130220-ee380-300.asx) (works in VLC and MPlayer)

The talk contains a detailed summary of the whole system, plus some new information like the details of our rendezvous system and graphs showing usage numbers. I thank the [Stanford Computer Systems Colloquium](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/) for giving me the opportunity to speak.
