Today, the Tor Project releases the first in a series of [annual reports](https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en). Drawing on our monthly reports, blog posts, and research papers, we produced a summary of research, advocacy, and outreach efforts during the year. It is both an introduction to the Tor Project and a way to keep track of our progress. There has been a lot of that in the past couple of years, so we hope you will take a look at the 2009 report and stay tuned for 2010.

The 2009 annual report can be downloaded at
