**New Releases** [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/october-2010-progress-report)

On October 29th, we released updated Tor Browser Bundles for OS X, Linux, and Windows. This is an upgrade to Firefox 3.6.12 which fixes a critical bug and OS X users' Torbutton will now show up.

On October 28th, we released new OSX Vidalia bundles which include Tor 0.2.2.17-alpha. Vidalia 0.2.10 changed the way we deal with the geoip databases by dropping the remote geoip lookups. This caused a lot of headaches for OS X users because of the layout of the package, but it's fixed in this version.

On October 27th, we released a new Tor Check to fix links to documentation urls, and clarify what users should do when getting the success result. [https://check.torproject.org](https://check.torproject.org "https://check.torproject.org").
