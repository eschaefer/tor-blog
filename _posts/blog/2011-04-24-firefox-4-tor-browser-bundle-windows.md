Windows users, your time has finally arrived! A new Tor Browser Bundle with Firefox 4 is available [here](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/tor-browser-2.2.24-1-alpha_en-US.exe) ([sig](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/tor-browser-2.2.24-1-alpha_en-US.exe.asc)). The build infrastructure has moved to a Windows 7 machine, but this bundle has been tested on both WinXP and Win7. If you encounter any strange issues, please let me know here or [on our bug tracker](https://trac.torproject.org).
