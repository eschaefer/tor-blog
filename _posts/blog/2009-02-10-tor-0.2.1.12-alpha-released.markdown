Tor 0.2.1.12-alpha features several more security-related fixes. You
should upgrade, especially if you run an exit relay (remote crash) or
a directory authority (remote infinite loop), or you're on an older
(pre-XP) or not-recently-patched Windows (remote exploit). It also
includes a big pile of minor bugfixes and cleanups.

Changes in version 0.2.1.12-alpha - 2009-02-08
**Security fixes:**

- Fix an infinite-loop bug on handling corrupt votes under certain
 circumstances. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.
- Fix a temporary DoS vulnerability that could be performed by
 a directory mirror. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha; reported by lark.
- Avoid a potential crash on exit nodes when processing malformed
 input. Remote DoS opportunity. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.

**Minor bugfixes:**

- Let controllers actually ask for the "clients\_seen" event for
 getting usage summaries on bridge relays. Bugfix on 0.2.1.10-alpha;
 reported by Matt Edman.
- Fix a compile warning on OSX Panther. Fixes bug 913; bugfix against
 0.2.1.11-alpha.
- Fix a bug in address parsing that was preventing bridges or hidden
 service targets from being at IPv6 addresses.
- Solve a bug that kept hardware crypto acceleration from getting
 enabled when accounting was turned on. Fixes bug 907. Bugfix on
 0.0.9pre6.
- Remove a bash-ism from configure.in to build properly on non-Linux
 platforms. Bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.
- Fix code so authorities \_actually\_ send back X-Descriptor-Not-New
 headers. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
- Don't consider expiring already-closed client connections. Fixes
 bug 893. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre20.
- Fix another interesting corner-case of bug 891 spotted by rovv:
 Previously, if two hosts had different amounts of clock drift, and
 one of them created a new connection with just the wrong timing,
 the other might decide to deprecate the new connection erroneously.
 Bugfix on 0.1.1.13-alpha.
- Resolve a very rare crash bug that could occur when the user forced
 a nameserver reconfiguration during the middle of a nameserver
 probe. Fixes bug 526. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
- Support changing value of ServerDNSRandomizeCase during SIGHUP.
 Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.
- If we're using bridges and our network goes away, be more willing
 to forgive our bridges and try again when we get an application
 request. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.

**Minor features:**

- Support platforms where time\_t is 64 bits long. (Congratulations,
 NetBSD!) Patch from Matthias Drochner.
- Add a 'getinfo status/clients-seen' controller command, in case
 controllers want to hear clients\_seen events but connect late.

**Build changes:**

- Disable GCC's strict alias optimization by default, to avoid the
 likelihood of its introducing subtle bugs whenever our code violates
 the letter of C99's alias rules.
