Hi all. A new release of [arm](http://www.atagar.com/arm/) is now available. Besides the normal batch of [bug fixes and minor features](http://www.atagar.com/arm/releaseNotes.php#1.4.4) this includes an [interactive interpretor for raw control port access](http://www.atagar.com/arm/images/screenshot_interpretor_full.png).

This is intended to be a tool for developers, highly knowledgeable operators, and anyone that would like to learn about Tor's control protocol. It provides usability improvements like tab completion and history scroll-back, along with IRC style interpretor commands...

- **/help** - provides usage information for all of the tor/interpretor commands and tor's configuration options
- **/info** - queries relay information via fingerprint, nickname, or IP address
- **/find** - searches the backlog for the given regex
- **/events** - displays any events that we've listened for
- **/write** - dumps the interpretor backlog to a file

This can both be used via a new page in the curses interface and as  
 [a standalone prompt](http://www.atagar.com/arm/images/screenshot_interpretorPrompt.png) by running "arm --prompt".

Hopefully I'm not the only person that finds this to be useful! -Damian
