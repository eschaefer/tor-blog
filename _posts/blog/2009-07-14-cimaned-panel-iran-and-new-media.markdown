I was invited to join a panel discussion on Iran and New Media hosted by the Center for International Media Assistance and the National Endowment for Democracy. The full 90 minute video is now online; as is my presentation.

The general overview of the panel is [http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html](http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html "http://cima.ned.org/events/new-media-in-iran.html")

A number of press people talked to me afterwards, including Al-Jazeera. There were reporters from Xinhua and China Daily in the audience as well. These reporters paid close attention to anything I said about China.

I spoke about what I knew and generally tried to avoid starting international incidents. A few of my answers to questions rambled a bit.

All in all it was a great panel and I learned more about what goes on inside Iran from the different panelists.
