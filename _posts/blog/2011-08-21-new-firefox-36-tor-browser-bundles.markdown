The stable Tor Browser Bundle for Windows and the beta Firefox 3.6 Tor Browser Bundles for Linux and OS X have been updated to Firefox 3.6.20.

We are currently building new versions of the experimental Tor Browser Bundles, this time containing Firefox 6; we will announce them when they are ready. Firefox 5 and the experimental Firefox 5 TBBs are no longer safe to use.
