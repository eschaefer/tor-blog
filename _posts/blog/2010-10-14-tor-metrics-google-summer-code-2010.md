Although it has been a while since GSoC ended, I want to give a quick run-down of my project and how everything went over the summer. The plan was to migrate the [Tor metrics portal](https://metrics.torproject.org/index.html "tor metrics portal") from the file based system to a database driven one. This allows us to have a more dynamic website and a better interface to derive our statistics and visuals from. I spent most of my time designing the database schema (which had to be carefully optimized due to the amount of data we have), and the remainder of the time working on things such as [dynamic graphs](https://metrics.torproject.org/graphs.html "dynamic graphs") and migrating the website to Java Server Pages. Thankfully, I finished almost everything I had planned to do, and it seems as though my work this summer is being put to good use! A significant amount of my metrics code has been merged, which is certainly a good feeling. [**read more »**](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-metrics-google-summer-code-2010)
