Welcome to the fourth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the [weekly newsletter](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news) that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.

The future of Private Browsing Mode
===================================

Mozilla Firefox, on which Tor Browser is based, offers users a “Private Browsing Mode” that aims solely to prevent browsing information from being saved locally. As Georg Koppen [pointed out](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2015-January/000217.html), “The question is now how to treat the other privacy-relevant areas like cross-origin linkability or fingerprinting?”

Georg proposed a “Private Browsing Mode+”, which would integrate the disk-avoidance, anti-tracking, anti-fingerprinting, and location-concealing elements of a privacy-preserving browser in a more logical way.

Miscellaneous news
==================

After a “[pretty big overhaul](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008211.html)”, Damian Johnson announced that [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/), the Tor controller library, now “lazy-loads” descriptors, resulting in a [considerable speed increase](https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git/commit/?id=3dac7c5) when reading network documents. “Note that descriptor validation is now opt-in rather than opt-out, so if you’d prefer validation over performance you’ll now need to include ‘validate = True’.”

The Tails team [set out](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-January/007945.html) the release schedule for Tails 1.3, and also published its [Code of Conduct](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/working_together/code_of_conduct/).

Arturo Filastò [reported](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2015-January/000238.html) on OONI-related activities at the Nexa Center’s [NNTools2015](http://nexa.polito.it/nntools2015) event.

Patrick Schleizer [wondered](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036581.html) how Tor Browser could be made to act more like a “system tor”, and sketched out a [possible plan](https://bugs.torproject.org/14121): “What do you think about this proposal in general?”
