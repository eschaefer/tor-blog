Tor started more than eleven years ago. The project website has gone through three major revisions in that time. It looks like it’s again time for important changes.

Tor has shifted in the recent years from being a project prominently used by researchers, developers, and security experts to the wider audience of anyone concerned about their privacy. Tor’s user base continues to grow. While this is a very good news for the anonymity of every Tor user, we need to make information that matters more accessible and better structured. The support team already receive [close to 30 new requests every day](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000419.html), and it would be a better experience for newcomers, users, and journalists to directly find their answers.

Creating the ideal website for Tor is not an easy task. We have very diverse audiences with very diverse expectations. We need to gather information from different sources. Some pages should be multi-lingual. As outdated information could endanger our users, it should be easy to keep up-to-date. Our users deserve beautiful, clear, and comprehensive graphics to allow everyone to quickly understand Tor better. We’ve had [some starting discussions](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3593), but we’re very much in need of your help.

Up to the challenge? Do you want to help improving a website visited everyday by millions of people looking for protection against surveillance? Then feel free to join the [website team mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team). We need usability experts, technical writers, designers, code wizards of the modern web, static website generator experts, documentalists… Join us and help!
