Tor 0.2.1.11-alpha finishes fixing the "if your Tor is off for a week it  
will take a long time to bootstrap again" bug. It also fixes an important  
security-related bug reported by Ilja van Sprundel. You should upgrade.  
(We'll send out more details about the bug once people have had some  
time to upgrade.)

Changes in version 0.2.1.11-alpha - 2009-01-20  
**Security fixes:**

- Fix a heap-corruption bug that may be remotely triggerable on  
 some platforms. Reported by Ilja van Sprundel.

**Major bugfixes:**

- Discard router descriptors as we load them if they are more than  
 five days old. Otherwise if Tor is off for a long time and then  
 starts with cached descriptors, it will try to use the onion  
 keys in those obsolete descriptors when building circuits. Bugfix  
 on 0.2.0.x. Fixes bug 887.

**Minor features:**

- Try to make sure that the version of Libevent we're running with  
 is binary-compatible with the one we built with. May address bug  
 897 and others.
- Make setting ServerDNSRandomizeCase to 0 actually work. Bugfix  
 for bug 905. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.
- Add a new --enable-local-appdata configuration switch to change  
 the default location of the datadir on win32 from APPDATA to  
 LOCAL\_APPDATA. In the future, we should migrate to LOCAL\_APPDATA  
 entirely. Patch from coderman.

**Minor bugfixes:**

- Make outbound DNS packets respect the OutboundBindAddress setting.  
 Fixes the bug part of bug 798. Bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha.
- When our circuit fails at the first hop (e.g. we get a destroy  
 cell back), avoid using that OR connection anymore, and also  
 tell all the one-hop directory requests waiting for it that they  
 should fail. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.
- In the torify(1) manpage, mention that tsocks will leak your  
 DNS requests.
