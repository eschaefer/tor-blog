Tor 0.2.3.5-alpha fixes two bugs that make it possible to enumerate
 bridge relays; fixes an assertion error that many users started hitting
 today; and adds the ability to refill token buckets more often than
 once per second, allowing significant performance improvements.

**Security fixes:**

- Bridge relays now do their directory fetches inside Tor TLS
 connections, like all the other clients do, rather than connecting
 directly to the DirPort like public relays do. Removes another
 avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes bug 4115; bugfix on 0.2.0.35.
- Bridges relays now build circuits for themselves in a more similar
 way to how clients build them. Removes another avenue for
 enumerating bridges. Fixes bug 4124; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha,
 when bridges were introduced.

**Major bugfixes:**

- Fix an "Assertion md->held\_by\_node == 1 failed" error that could
 occur when the same microdescriptor was referenced by two node\_t
 objects at once. Fix for bug 4118; bugfix on Tor 0.2.3.1-alpha.

**Major features (networking):**

- Add a new TokenBucketRefillInterval option to refill token buckets
 more frequently than once per second. This should improve network
 performance, alleviate queueing problems, and make traffic less
 bursty. Implements proposal 183; closes ticket 3630. Design by
 Florian Tschorsch and Bj√∂rn Scheuermann; implementation by
 Florian Tschorsch.

**Minor bugfixes:**

- Change an integer overflow check in the OpenBSD\_Malloc code so
 that GCC is less likely to eliminate it as impossible. Patch
 from Mansour Moufid. Fixes bug 4059.

**Minor bugfixes (usability):**

- Downgrade log messages about circuit timeout calibration from
 "notice" to "info": they don't require or suggest any human
 intervention. Patch from Tom Lowenthal. Fixes bug 4063;
 bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha.

**Minor features (diagnostics):**

- When the system call to create a listener socket fails, log the
 error message explaining why. This may help diagnose bug 4027.
