Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 1.1.1, is out.

All users must [upgrade](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/) as soon as possible: this release fixes [numerous security issues](https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.1/).

[Download it now.](https://tails.boum.org/download/)

**Changes**

Notable user-visible changes include:

-   Security fixes
    -   Upgrade the web browser to 24.8.0esr-0+tails1\~bpo70+1 (Firefox 24.8.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    -   Add an I2P boot parameter. Without adding "i2p" to the kernel command line, I2P will not be accessible for the Live user. I2P was also upgraded to 0.9.14.1-1\~deb7u+1, and stricter firewall rules are applied to it, among other security enhancements.
    -   Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.23-2\~d70.wheezy+1 (fixes CVE-2014-5117).
    -   Upgrade Linux to 3.14.15-2 (fixes CVE-2014-3534, CVE-2014-4667 and CVE-2014-4943).
    -   Prevent dhclient from sending the hostname over the network ([ticket \#7688](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7688)).
    -   Override the hostname provided by the DHCP server ([ticket \#7769](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7769)).
-   Bugfixes
    -   Don't ship OpenJDK 6: I2P prefers v7, and we don't need both ([ticket \#7807](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7807)).
    -   Prevent Tails Installer from updating the system partition properties on MBR partitions ([ticket \#7716](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7716)).
-   Minor improvements
    -   Upgrade to Torbutton 1.6.12.1.
    -   Install gnome-user-guide ([ticket \#7618](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7618)).
    -   Install cups-pk-helper ([ticket \#7636](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7636)).
    -   Update the SquashFS sort file, which should speed up boot from DVD ([ticket \#6372](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6372)).
    -   Compress the SquashFS more aggressively ([ticket \#7706](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7706)) which should make the Tails ISO image smaller.
