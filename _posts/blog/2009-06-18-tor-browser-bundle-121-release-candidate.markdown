In continuing to [improve TBB](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/testing-tor-browser-bundle-121dev) for a vast array of users, here's the release candidate for Tor Browser Bundle 1.2.1.

I appreciate your feedback, comments, and bugs filed so far about TBB 1.2.1-dev.

You can find here the updated [TBB 1.2.1-1-dev](https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/dist/tor-im-browser-1.2.1-1-dev_en-US.exe), [sig](https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/dist/tor-im-browser-1.2.1-1-dev_en-US.exe.asc), and [sha1](https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/dist/tor-im-browser-1.2.1-1-dev_en-US.exe.sha1) files.

The changes since the last test are:

- Update Pidgin to 2.5.6r2
- Update Firefox to 3.0.11
- Include OpenSSL 0.9.8k DLL and stop using the system ssl dll
